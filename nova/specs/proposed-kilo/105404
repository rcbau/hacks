+====================
+rootwrap daemon mode
+====================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/rootwrap-daemon-mode
+
+Nova is one of projects that heavily depends on executing actions on compute
+and network nodes that require root priviledges on Linux system. Currently this
+is achieved with oslo.rootwrap that has to be run with sudo. Both sudo and
+rootwrap produce significant performance overhead. This blueprint is one of the
+series of blueprints that would cover mitigating rootwrap part of the overhead
+using new mode of operations for rootwrap - daemon mode. These blueprints will
+be created in several projects starting with oslo.rootwrap [#rw_bp]_.
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+As you can see in [#ne_ml]_ rootwrap presents big performance overhead for
+Neutron. Impact on Nova is not as signigicant since most of the work is done
+with libvirt's API but it is still there.
+Details of the overhead are covered in [#rw_bp]_.
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+This blueprint proposes adopting upcoming change in oslo.rootwrap that would
+allow to run rootwrap daemon. The daemon will work just as a usual rootwrap but
+will accept commands to be run over authenticated UNIX domain socket instead of
+command line and will run continuously in background.
+
+Note that this is not usual RPC over some message queue. It uses UNIX socket,
+so no remote connections are available. It also uses digest authentication with
+key shared over stdout (pipe) with parent process, so no other processes will
+have access to the daemon. Further details of rootwrap daemon are covered in
+[#rw_bp]_.
+
+``use_rootwrap_daemon`` configuration option should be added that will make
+``utils.execute`` use daemon instead of usual rootwrap.
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+Alternative approaches have been discussed for Neutron in [#ne_eth]_.
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+None
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+None
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+
+This change requires additional endpoint to be available to run as root -
+``nova-rootwrap-daemon``. It should be added to the ``sudoers`` file.
+
+All security issues with using client+daemon instead of plain rootwrap are
+covered in [#rw_bp]_.
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+
+None
+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+
+None
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+This change introduces performance boost for disk and network operations that
+are required to be run with root priviledges in ``nova-compute`` and
+``nova-network``. Current state of rootwrap daemon shows over 10x speedup
+comparing to usual ``sudo rootwrap`` call. Total speedup for Nova will be less
+impressive but should be noticeable.
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+This change introduces new config variable ``use_rootwrap_daemon`` that
+switches on new behavior. Note that by default ``use_rootwrap_daemon`` will be
+turned off so to get the speedup one will have to turn it on. With it turned on
+``nova-rootwrap-daemon`` is used to run commands that require root priviledges.
+
+This change also introduces new binary ``nova-rootwrap-daemon`` that should
+be deployed beside ``nova-rootwrap`` and added to ``sudoers``.
+
+Developer impact
+----------------
+
+None
+
+Implementation
+==============

+
+Work Items
+----------
+
+The only work item here is to implement new config variable and run rootwrap in
+daemon mode with it.
+
+Dependencies
+============
+
+* rootwrap-daemon-mode blueprint in oslo.rootwrap [#rw_bp]_.
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+This change doesn't change APIs so it doesn't require additional integration
+tests. If tempest is happy with ``use_rootwrap_daemon`` turned on, the feature
+works.
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+None
