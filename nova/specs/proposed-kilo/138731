Subject: [PATCH] Allow setting the emulator for libvirt guests

+=============================================
+Allow setting the emulator for libvirt guests
+=============================================
+
+Include the URL of your launchpad blueprint:
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/example
+
+This will allow the administrator to explicitly set the libvirt
+emulator, which can make upgrades easier.
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+If no emulator is specified in the guest configuration passed to
+libvirt, it will determine the "best" emulator to use. This is usually
+correct, but Nova supplies no facility for overriding this on the
+occasions that it is not.
+
+Use Cases
+----------
+
+When upgrading an emulator (e.g., qemu), having this option available
+could be very useful. Without such an option, an upgrade plan might
+look like:
+
+#. Down the compute node.
+#. Upgrade qemu.
+#. Perform tests to ensure qemu sanity.
+#. Bring the compute node up.
+
+Rollback might require again downing the compute node, downgrading
+qemu (which presumably your package manager makes easy, but perhaps
+not), re-testing, and bringing the node back up.
+
+With this option, the upgrade can be done with less downtime:
+
+#. Set the emulator option to the current (older) version of qemu.
+#. Install the new qemu in parallel.
+#. Perform tests to ensure sanity of the new qemu.
+#. Change or remove the emulator option.
+#. Restart nova compute.
+
+And rollback becomes easier as well: Simply restore the emulator
+option to its previous value and restart nova-compute. Depending on
+the change management process, re-testing the older qemu may not even
+be necessary because it was never removed from the system or changed,
+so it remains in a known-working state.
+
+qemu has been used here for conciseness, but this will work for any
+emulator.
+
+Project Priority
+-----------------
+
+This does not align directly with any of the kilo priorities, but it
+solves a similar pain point as the "No downtime DB upgrades."
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+We will add a single option, ``emulator``, in the ``[libvirt]``
+section, which may be set to the full path to the desired emulator to
+use. This will be added to the guest config that is passed off to
+libvirt.
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+The desired emulator could be set on a per-instance basis, but that's
+quite a bit more complicated and it's unclear how much benefit that
+would have. It might be able to slightly increase confidence in
+emulator upgrades -- for instance, the administrator could install the
+new qemu, spawn a few instances using it, then perform the upgrade en
+masse -- but it could also cause problems if instances remained pinned
+to older emulators. In the absence of any obvious demand for such a
+feature, it will be left as a single global option, which does not
+preclude setting the emulator for individual instances if a need
+arises in the future.
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+None.
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+None.
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+
+None.
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+
+None.
+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+
+None.
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+None.
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+One new configuration option will be added, but its default will be
+the same as the current behavior. It will never be *necessary* to set
+this option, and deployers will only need to consider setting it
+during well-managed emulator upgrades.
+
+Developer impact
+----------------
+
+None.

+
+Work Items
+----------
+
+As this is a very simple change, it would be performed as a single
+review that adds the option and its implementation.
+
+Dependencies
+============
+
+None.
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+New unit tests would be sufficient to ensure that the guest
+configuration is as expected.
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+Docs needed for the new option.
+
+References
+==========
+
+None.
