+========================================================
+Fix the race conditions when migration with server-group
+========================================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/fix-race-when-migration-with-server-group
+
+The aim of this feature is to resolve the race condition when migrating
+instance with server-group.
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+After implement persist scheduler-hints and assign new scheduler-hints. The
+scheduler will honor the group hints when migration. But there still have
+race conditions when migrating instance with server-group, those race problem
+may violate the policy of server-group.
+
+Use Cases
+---------
+
+When resize/migrate/live_migrate/rebuild/evacuate instance with server-group,
+the instance shouldn't violate the policy of server-group.
+
+Project Priority
+----------------
+
+This feature is valuable for scheduler and user, although it's not part of
+global effort. But the current migration with server-group is buggy. So we
+need fix those race conditions.
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+The propose is when populate hosts in the group should consider the orignal
+host and new host when migration.
+
+So it need track the migration, currently only resize/migrate will create
+new record in migrations table. We should create record also for
+evacuate/live_migration/rebuild.
+
+For each case, described at below:
+
+Affinity server group:
+* Migrate instance out from hostA into hostB, at sametime the new instance
+deploy:
+
+  The new instance may place both hostA and hostB. This can be accepted.
+
+Anti-Affinity:
+* Migrate instance to hostA, at sametime new instance deploy to hostA
+
+  Create migration record before instance's host update. And change
+  the way of populate group hosts, it should count new hosts for any instance
+  in migrating. Then there won't have any new instance will deploy to hostA
+
+* Migrate instance to hostA, after instance's host updated, then rollback
+
+  Create migration record after instance's host updated. And
+  change the way of pupulate group hosts, it should count old host for any
+  instance in migrating. Then when rollback happened, the server group policy
+  won't be violated.
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+Store the new host and orignal host in instance_extra table with new column
+'migration_info'. But we already have migration table, and another table to
+record similar info is confuse.
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+This propose will use existed migration table, so there isn't any data model
+change.
