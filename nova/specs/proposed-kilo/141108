between arguments and JSON requests and replies and exceptions.

+==========================================
+Wrap the Python NeutronClient
+==========================================
+
+Include the URL of your launchpad blueprint:
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/nova-neutron-refactor
+
+The Neutron client module used by the Neutron implementation of the
+Openstack Network API is a basic, thin wrapper around the Neutron API.
+Direct use of the module's functionality has resulted in pervasive adaptive
+code throughout the API adapter implementation. The repetitive and
+occasionally opaque nature of this code makes the implemenation difficult
+to debug and maintain. Providing higher level, Nova oriented abstractions
+by wrapping the existing client:
+
+* Make it easier to implement readable implementations of the networking
+  API implementation.
+
+* Allows knowledge of the functioning of the Neutron API to be captured in
+  code for reuse by all developers, independent of their Neutron API
+  expertise. This is maintable, extensible and testable in itself.
+
+* Provides a natural boundary to hide neutron specific details such as:
+
+  * thrown exceptions
+
+  * JSON request and response translation
+
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+Direct use of the neutronclient module is pervasive throughout the
+implementation of the Network API adapter. This has the following
+consequences:
+
+* Construction of JSON requests and parsing of replies is repeated
+  throughout the code.
+
+* Neutron specific exceptions are allowed to permeate the API boundary to
+  the caller.
+
+* How well the Neutron client is used varies depending on the expertise of
+  the respective authors. There is no mechanism for capturing best
+  practices that is immediately available to developers.
+
+* Changes to the Neutron client can require pervasive changes to the
+  adapter implementation.
+
+
+Use Cases
+----------
+
+* Nova developers should not need to have direct knowledge of Neutron client
+  or API specific details to perform rudimentary code changes.
+
+* Developers with Neutron expertise need a mechanism to capture best
+  practices in an accessible and immediately useful way for themselves and
+  other developers.
+
+
+Project Priority
+-----------------
+
+This refactoring addresses an issue of significant techncial dept and
+facilitates Nova to Neutron migration.
+
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+Provide higher level abstractions of the Neutron client calls used by Nova
+by through a class (or family of classes if required). The classes hide
+construction of JSON requests, translation of replies to Nova objects and
+Neutron exceptions to Nova exceptions.
+
+The addition of tempest tests that directly exercise the wrapper provide
+concrete verification of the interpretation of the Neutron API that Nova
+relies on.
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+Continue to directly use the Neutron client "in-place", possibly mitigating
+code repetition through helper methods and performing ad-hoc exception
+translation through alternate means such as decorators.

+Data model impact

+None

+REST API impact

+Security impact

+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+None
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+It is expected that additional source files will be created. Deployment
+tools that are not wild card based in file selection will need to be
+modified to include the new files.
+
+
+Developer impact
+----------------
+
+The results of this effort are to be consumed in the refactoring of the
+adapter so only has impact to developers working on this effort.
+
+
+Implementation

+
+Assignee(s)
+-----------
+
+Primary assignee: Brent Eagles (beagles@redhat.com)
+
+One or more sponsors from the core teams should have direct involvement
+in an, at minimum, advisory capacity. Particularly:
+
+* Dan Smith for Nova objects
+* Matt Riedemann
+* Maru Newby (Neutron)
+
+
+Primary assignee:
+* Brent Eagles  beagles@redhat.com
+
+
+Work Items
+----------
+
+1. Create a class that provides higher level methods for neutron client.
+2. Create tempest tests to excerise wrapper.
+
+
+Dependencies
+============
+
+None
+
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+As this is part of the Nova-Neutron API refactoring, a CI job will in the
+experimental work queue will run the new Tempest tests
