+Local snapshot for reducing data transfer when booting up multiple VMs
+======================================================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/local-snapshot-for-reducing-boot-
+up-data-transfer
+
+Nova supports to boot up virtual machines (VMs) through Cinder-based volume or
+snapshot. When multiple homogeneous VMs are booted, the boot-up data has to be
+transferred for each VM even if some of the VMs are on the same host. This is a
+waste of both bandwidth and time. To address this problem, we propose to
+realize cinder-based, compute-side local snapshot (called VMT-snapshot). By
+this means the boot-up data needs to be transferred only once for each host.
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+Currently, Nova supports to boot up virtual machines (VMs) through Cinder-based
+volume or snapshot. When booting up a single VM, these approaches can reduce
+network load through on-demand transfer of boot-up data. However, when multiple
+homogeneous VMs are booted, the boot-up data has to be transferred seperately
+for each VM even if some of the VMs are on the same host, which results in
+unnecessarily high network load and long boot-up delay.
+
+Use Cases
+----------
+
+We propose a new type of snapshot (VMT-snapshot) to address the above mentioned
+problem. End users will be able to use VMT-snapshot to boot up multiple
+homogeneous VMs. This will reduce boot-up data transfer and accelerate the
+boot-up process.

+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+We propose to realize cinder-based compute-side local snapshot (called
+VMT-snapshot) to boot up multiple homogeneous VMs. As depicted below, we add a
+(transparent) local cache layer between the remote original volume and the
+VMT-snapshots so that only one copy of boot-up data is needed on one host.
+
+````
+
+remote original volume --> local cache --> VMT-snapshot(s)
+
+````
+
+A compute node creates and uses VMT-snapshot in the following steps, the
+structure of which is depicted below.
+1. Attach the remote original volume (through iSCSI) as a read-only volume
+(VolumeO).
+2. Use local storage of the compute node as a (shared) cache of VolumeO.
+3. Create a writable diff volume (VolumeU) for each VM to store the VMâ€™s
+private data.
+4. Create VMT-snapshot (using Linux device mapper module) upon the cache and
+writable volume.
+5. Boot up a VM on top of the snapshot.
+
+````
+
++-----------------------------------------+
+|             Snapshot                    |
++-----------------------------------------+
+
++----------------------------+  +---------+
+|           Cache            |  | VolumeU |
++----------------------------+  +---------+
+
++----------------------------+
+|          VolumeO           |
++----------------------------+
+
+````
+
+To construct the shared local cache of VolumeO (in the above step 2), the
+following changes are needed.
+* Add the cache module (e.g., bcache) support into nova virt drivers.
+* After the volume attached, create cache for it.
+* Use a database record to indicate whether a volume has cache.
+* Remove cache before detaching the volume.
+
+Besides the operations of VMT-snapshot, the modification to nova itself is
+light-weighted:
+1. creation: We add a driver class extends the original class
+"DriverVolumeBlockDevice" in file "nova/virt/block_device.py" to prepare the
+VMT-snapshot.
+2. deletion: We call the delete method of VMT-snapshot in file"nova/compute/
+manager.py'.
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+Direct image access:
+(https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/nova-image-zero-copy).
+This approach uses the direct_url of the Glance v2 API, such that the number of
+hops to transfer an image to a Nova-compute node is decreased. This approach
+cannot reduce the boot-up data transfer for multiple VMs on one host.

+Notifications impact

+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+
+We modify Horizon to add an option "boot from VMT-snapshot" in the drop-down
+list. End users can choose "boot from VMT-snapshot" in the drop-down list in
+the dashboard and enter the number of VMs to boot up.
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+VMT-snapshot can significantly reduce data transfer when multiple homogeneous
+VMs are booted on the same host.
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+To use VMT-snapshot, configure "nova.conf" set "use_vmtsnapshot = true". This
+will enable the option "boot from VMT-snapshot" in the drop-down list in the
+dashboard.

+
+Assignee(s)
+-----------
+
+Primary assignee: John Zhang
+
+Work Items
+----------
+
+* Add VMT-snapshot package
+* Add new create/delete functions in nova
+* Test with Nova
+
+Dependencies
+============
+
+(https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Cinder/blueprints/multi-attach-volume)
+VMT-snapshot depends on the functionality of multi-attach volume, which allows
+the remote original volume to be attached to more than one host simultaneously.
+
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+In order to show the effectiveness we will add necessary tests into nova's test
+framework.
+* Add unit tests
+* Have CI running tempest for Kilo, which will validate this work.
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+We need to document how to create many homogeneous virtual machines though our
+new option.
