Subject: [PATCH] Nova trusted geo-asset tag

This spec covers how geo and asset tagging can be incorporated
to OpenStack Nova to provide location and boundary control of
workloads/OpenStack images. With Geo/Asset Tags, you can enforce
policies to control placement, migration or bursting of workloads
to trusted systems in specific geographical locations or boundaries.

+==========================================
+
+Include the URL of your launchpad blueprint:
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/nova-trusted-geo-asset-tag
+
+This blueprint details how geo and asset tagging can be incorporated and
+taken advantage of in OpenStack clouds to provide location and boundary
+control of workloads/OpenStack images. With Geo/Asset Tags, you can enforce
+policies to control placement, migration or bursting of workloads to trusted
+systems in specific geographical locations or boundaries, provide visibility
+and compliance of your workload policies to ensure tenants that of its
+compliance to Trust and location policies.
+
+Extensions from this solution enable associating geo and asset tags with
+hardware at provision time. Intel Trusted Execution Environment (TXT) and
+other measured launch environments (MLEs) facilitate measurement of provision
+time information into the Trusted Platform Module (TPM). Remote attestation
+services can then be used to ascertain that provision time meta-data have not
+been tampered. Geo and Asset tagging builds on the Trusted Compute Pools
+feature, covered in TrustedComputingPools
+
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+While the cloud enables workloads and data to reside anywhere, users may be
+constrained to run their workloads and save their data in certain geographies
+due to regulatory requirements. This solution will extend to include trusting
+the location and boundary of the hardware resources, extending the current
+functionality of trusting the integrality of the compute platform to be free
+of malware and rootkits.
+
+Use Cases
+----------
+
+Use case 1
+The end-user can enforce VM/Images policies to control placement,
+migration or bursting of workloads to trusted systems within specific
+geographical locations or boundaries
+
+
+Project Priority
+-----------------
+
+Does this blueprint fit under one of the :ref:`kilo-priorities`? If so which one
+and how?
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+Create a new nova-scheduler filter which supports both trust and geo-tag filters.
+
+Geo and asset tag solution:
+To create and add Geo-Location/Asset-tag Policies to VM Image Properties in
+Open Stack
+
+If Trust Policy for Location is selected, Platform Integrity is automatically
+selected.
+When selecting the Location Trust; user will have option to create policy of
+one or more of the 5 Key name and value pairs.
+key names include: Country, State, City. Region and Classification.
+Acceptable values for each Key Name will need to be selected from a drop down
+list. The acceptable values are fetched from the Remote Attestation Solution
+
+Asset/Location Filter in Scheduler to orchestrate and control Trust Policies.
+
+When a user selects an image to be launched for an instance, the scheduler
+retrieves the Trust Policy for the Glance database
+Scheduler iterates through the available host and fetches the SAML assertion
+from the Remote Attestation Service using Restful API.
+SAML Assertion is parsed to determine match to the Trust Policy and once
+these iterations are completed, scheduler will complete the remaining filter
+operation and then picks the best ranked host to launch the instance.
+
+Trust Visibility within OpenStack Horizon
+
+Horizon dashboards have been updated to display Trust Status in 2 dashboards
+under the Admin Tab  Hypervisor and Instances
+The Hypervisor dashboard displays trust status of all Policies (Platform and Location).
+In addition, when you mouse over the location icon it will show the Asset/Geo tag
+provisioned in the Hardware of the host.
+Every time the Hypervisor dashboard is loaded, Trust Status is updated by
+fetching the SAML assertion from the Remote Attestation Service using Restful API.
+The Instance dashboard displays trust status of all Policies (Platform and Location).
+In addition, when you mouse over the location icon it will show the
+Location/ Tag Policy applied.
+if there are no Trust policies associated to the image the Instance is using,
+then the Trust Status for that instance will be empty.
+Trusted Icons for each policy will be displayed in green and untrusted in Red

+
+Image attributes changes
+Image attributes are stored in the Glance DB
+
+id | image_id                             | name        | value
+
+47 | 934bf0cd-82ab-4edb-b6ff-1407d99c0386 | trust       | true
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+What other ways could we do this thing? Why aren't we using those? This doesn't
+have to be a full literature review, but it should demonstrate that thought has
+been put into why the proposed solution is an appropriate one.
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+None
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+Here is the format that we are expecting with the glance image create command
+glance image-create --name cirros --disk-format qcow2 --min-disk 10
+--min-ram 1024 --file cirros-0.3.1-x86_64-disk.img  --property trust=true
+--property tags="{'country': 'US', 'state': 'CA'}}" --container-format bare
+
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+
+Yes, the purpose of this BP is to make the cloud more secure
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+
+None
+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+
+Trust status and Geo-location policies are now visible in the horizon dashboard
+
+4 image files are added that represent geo-location, platform trusted,
+platform un-trusted and platform trusted with geo-location policy
+
+The user will be able to add Geo-Location/Asset-tag Policies to VM Image Properties
+in horizon
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+We dont have a local cache at this point. When a user launches an instance,
+the new trust filter checks the geo Tags of each of the compute nodes in
+sequential order. (No local cache is maintained). So, the instance creation wait
+time is directly proportional to the number of compute nodes available in the Cloud.
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+Modifications required after the user deploys and configured OpenStack
+
+Configuration changes for Nova.conf
+
+[trusted_computing]
+
+  asset_tag_server =
+  asset_tag_port
+  asset_tag_server_url =
+  asset_tag_server_auth_blob=
+
+Developer impact

+None

+Work Items
+----------
+
+None
+
+Dependencies
+============
+
+The end user will need of attestation authority appliance for this new nova
+filter to work.  If the feature does not exist instances would not launch
+if trust policy is set to true, If false, instances would launch and our new
+trust filter would not play a role in the decision.
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+Intel will test end-end functionality internally at our test facility.
+We will provide all the test cases and test results along with code submissions.
+
+Others who want to download and test can access Attestation server appliance
+by contacting Intel:  jwheeler at intel dot com
+
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+Use case, Code, deployment and test case documentation will provided at a later date.
