+Make Resource Tracker Use Objects
+==========================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/make-resource-tracker-use-objects
+
+This blueprint was approved for Juno but missed feature freeze.
+
+Nova is converting data structures it uses to communicate via RPC and through
+the database to use an object encapsulation called Nova Objects. This supports
+of multi-versioning for live-upgrade and database schema independence. This
+blueprint covers the conversion of the resource tracker to use Nova Objects.
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+Conversion to Nova Objects will replace dict data structures that are currently
+communicated via the conductor API with Nova Object versions. Where necessary
+the Nova Objects will be extended to cover parameters that are not already
+implemented.
+
+Use Cases
+---------
+
+As an operator I want to be able to upgrade Nova without any downtime.
+
+Project Priority
+----------------
+
+This blueprint fits under the Live Upgrades priority.
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+The Nova Object classes that will be used include:
+
+- ComputeNode
+- Instance
+- Migrations
+- Flavor
+- Service
+
+The ComputeNode object is currently missing some parameters that exist
+in the compute_nodes table and are used in the resource tracker. The
+following parameters will be added to the ComputeNode:
+
+- pci_stats
+
+In addition, the following fields exist in the compute_nodes table but
+are not currently used by the resource tracker. We propose not to add fields
+to the ComputeNode object unless they are used, so these fields will not
+be added as part of this blueprint.
+
+- extra_resources
+
+When complete there will be no direct calls to conductor in the resource
+tracker.
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+There is another effort to split the scheduler from Nova. When the split is
+complete the resource tracker may no longer interact with the scheduler via
+the database.  Initially, the scheduler-lib blueprint (see references) will
+make all compute node interaction with the scheduler go through a new
+scheduler library in preparation for the split.
+
+This suggests that it might be unnecessary to use the ComputeNode object at
+least. However, it is reasonable to continue using the ComputeNode object
+even if it is not used to persist data in the database, so we will go ahead
+with the existing plan to implement it.
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+The objects isolate the code from the database schema. They are written to
+operate with existing data model versions. At present the scheduler does not
+the ComputeNode object, so code there will need to tolerate changes in
+database schema or the format of data stored in fields.
+
+The fields that need to be added to the ComputeNode object are as follows:
+
+**pci_stats**
+
+Database field type: text
+
+Object field type: fields.ObjectField('PciDeviceList', nullable=True)
+
+The pci_stats field is currently populated with a PciDeviceList serialized
+as an object primitive. This is already the correct form for an object field.
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+None.
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+
+None.
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+
+None.
+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+
+None.
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+None.
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+The objects are written to be compatible with the database schema used in
+Juno. There is no database migration associated with this blueprint and
+the format of data stored in the fields of the database will not change. This
+means that a combination of Juno and Kilo versions of the compute nodes
+will be able to coexist and interact with the scheduler.
+
+Developer impact
+----------------
+
+Developers working on the resource tracker will be required to use the new
+objects instead of directly making database calls to conductor.

+
+Work Items
+----------
+
+* Use flavor object in resource tracker
+
+* Use Service object in resource tracker
+
+* Use Instance object in resource tracker
+
+* Use Migrations object in resource tracker
+
+* Use ComputeNode object in resource tracker
+
+Some of these work items are currently ready for review:
+https://review.openstack.org/#/q/topic:bp/make-resource-tracker-use-objects,n,z
+
+Dependencies
+============
+
+None
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+This does not affect existing tempest tests. Unit tests will be
+added for each object and existing tests will be modified to deal
+with the new data structure.
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+No new features or API changes so no document impact.
