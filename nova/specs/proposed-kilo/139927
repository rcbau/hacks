Subject: [PATCH] Fake libvirt for testing feature need real HW

Add a fake libvirt driver to supporting features testing
which require real HW existing for running, i.e. PCI and
SRIOV.

Implements blueprint fake-libvirt-hw-testing-driver

+Fake Libvirt driver for simulating HW testing
+================================================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/fake-libvirt-hw-testing-driver
+
+Add a fake libvirt driver to supporting features testing which require real
+HW existing for running, i.e. PCI and SRIOV.
+
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+The existing feature like PCI and SRIOV need to be fully tested by CI,but for
+now, running a tempest in a VM can not well provide a simulated PCI devices
+and iommu.
+
+The issues currently known, are:
+
+
+1. PCI and SRIOV lack of CI testing facility, just unit testing which is
+obvious not enough.
+
+2. CI running tempest in Virtual Machine, testing PCI pass-through or SRIOV
+means need pass-through the simulated PCI devices to secondary level of
+virtual machines. nested visualization is not mature.
+
+3. There might more and more features likely need real HW(hardware) to fully
+tested, we need a common way to verify such features.
+
+
+Use Cases
+---------
+
+Testing feature which need real HW to run.
+
+
+Project Priority
+----------------
+
+None
+
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+Provide a fake libvirt python library, assume name is 'mocklibvirt'. then
+make the nova libvirt driver use the 'mocklibvirt' instead of 'libvirt'.
+
+mocklibvirt provide minimal setting up for testing a PCI pass-through or
+SRIOV.
+
+1. Provide all necessary informations to nova libvirt driver to make it
+could running with the mocklibvirt.
+
+2. Log needed informations to help analysis the feature of Nova does
+work or not.
+
+3. make easy interface to feature testing, i.e provide method easy provide
+information to nova libvirt, provide interface to retrieve the information
+nova generated.
+
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+The mocklibvirt had it's own pitfall:
+
+a) Not really verify the HW and hypervisor's functionality.
+
+b) Most likely fake libvirt is not only nova project, maybe need a new
+project.
+
+c) Fake a libvir could be time consuming, testing for currently features
+is kind of urgent task.
+
+the available alternatives include:
+
+1. Third-Party CI is a major and fast way to provide test features like PCI
+pass-through and the SRIOV. but need setting up new CI for every different
+HW.
+
+2.    Instead fake the libvirt, another choice is fake a nova libvirt driver.
+in this way, there are some code in the nova libvirt driver can not be
+tested. so this way is UN-likely to testing all codes.

+-----------
+
+Primary assignee:
+  Yongli He
+
+
+Work Items
+----------
+
+1. In ``nova/virt/libvirt/driver.py``:
+Making the libvirt importing configurable.
+
+2. Creating a new project/or nova sub project to implementing the mocklibvirt.
+
+
+
+Dependencies
+============
+
+* Software versions:
+  - Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher
+
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+Unit test:
+* Existing Nova unit tests should suffice for changed to Nova.
+
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+* Doc changes for the libvirt choice will be made as needed.
