Subject: [PATCH] Quiesce admin action for consistent snapshot

Currently we need to quiesce filesystems (fsfreeze) manually before
snapshotting cinder volumes attached to active instances to create consistent
backups. This should be automated when QEMU Guest Agent is enabled.
To achieve the automated quiescing, Nova should expose an admin action to
quiesce the guest file systems for Cinder.

+Quiesce admin action for consistent snapshot
+=====================================================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/quiesce-admin-action
+
+To make an online snapshot of cinder volumes consistent, we need to quiesce
+guest file systems before taking snapshot. When QEMU Guest Agent is installed
+in a kvm instance, we can automate the quiescing.
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+Currently we need to quiesce filesystems (fsfreeze) manually before
+snapshotting cinder volumes attached to active instances to create consistent
+backups. This should be automated when QEMU Guest Agent is enabled.
+To achieve the automated quiescing, Nova should expose an admin action to
+quiesce the guest file systems for Cinder.
+
+(Quiescing for nova image snapshot is covered by another proposal [1]_).
+
+Use Cases
+---------
+
+With this feature, users can create an online snapshot with consistent
+file systems state while the instances are running.
+
+It will be good for:
+
+* taking a quick backup before installing or upgrading softwares.
+* automatically taking backup volumes every night.

+Project Priority

+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+Expose 'quiesce' and 'unquiesce' admin actions for Cinder.
+
+Add a 'quiesce' and 'unquiesce' method for each driver. In libvirt driver,
+if QEMU Guest Agent is enabled in an instance, the guest agent is called
+to freeze the filesystems (and applications if fsfreeze-hook is installed)
+by 'quiesce' method. The 'unquiesce' method will thaw them.
+
+The prerequisites of this feature are:
+
+1. the hypervisor is 'qemu' or 'kvm'
+
+2. libvirt >= 1.2.5 (which has fsFreeze/fsThaw API) is installed in the
+   hypervisor
+
+3. 'hw_qemu_guest_agent=yes' properties are set on the image metadata,
+   and QEMU Guest Agent is installed and enabled in the instance
+
+Cinder should call the APIs only if new parameter 'quiesce=True' is specified
+to snapshot-create API.
+
+When these conditions are not satisfied, the methods will fail by
+'QuiesceUnsupportedException'.
+When quiesce is failed even though these conditions are satisfied
+(e.g. the agent is not responding), the methods fail by the other
+exception, such as LibvirtException.

+Data model impact
+-----------------

+None
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+* URL:
+    * /v2/{tenant_id}/servers/{server_id}/action:
+    * /v2.1/servers/{server_id}/action/{server_id}/action:
+
+* Request method:
+    * POST
+
+* JSON request body for 'quiesce'::
+
+        {
+            "quiesce": null
+        }
+
+* JSON request body for 'unquiesce'::
+
+        {
+            "unquiesce": null
+        }
+
+* This operation does not return a response body.
+
+* Normal response code:
+    * `200 OK`: Returned after the instances' filesystes are successfully
+      quiesced/unquiesced.
+
+* Error response codes:
+    * `500 Internal Server Error`: Returned if the driver fails to
+      quiesce/unquiesce
+    * For malformed requests, other error codes may be returned like the other
+      server admin actions.

+None
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+While taking snapshots, disk writes from the instance are blocked.

+
+Work Items
+----------
+
+1. Add 'quiesce' and 'unquiesce' server admin actions APIs for Nova
+2. Implement 'quiesce' and 'unquiesce' methods in libvirt driver [2]_
+3. Call the APIs from Cinder snapshot code
+4. Enable the test to run in CI with libvirt >= 1.2.5
+
+
+Dependencies
+============
+
+None
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+Live snapshotting of volumes with a guest booted with qemu-guest-agent should
+be added to scenario tests.
+Note that it requires environment with libvirt >= 1.2.5.
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+New REST APIs (server admin actions) should be added to the API documentation.
+Also, need to document how to use this feature in the operation guide (which
+currently recommends you use the fsfreeze tool manually).
