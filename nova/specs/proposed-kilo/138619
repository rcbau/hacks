Subject: [PATCH] Use the storage of compute nodes as cache of remote cinder
 volumes

We propose to realize CacheGroup, which caches data on local storage
devices of the compute nodes so that they can access data in their
local cache instead of in the remote cinder servers.

+==============================================================================
+Use the storage of compute nodes as cache of remote cinder volumes
+==============================================================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/add-cachegroup-support
+
+Cache is desirable when we do read/write with conventional hard disk drives
+(HDDs). There are some block level cache solutions, such as bcache, dm-cache,
+flashcache, and lvm-cache, which use fast but expensive storage (e.g., SSD) as
+cache of HDD. As an analogy, when virtual machines (VMs) do I/O operations
+with remote storage servers, local cache at the compute nodes is also helpful
+to reduce I/O latency and improve I/O throughput. So we propose to add local
+cache support in nova to use the storage of compute nodes as cache of remote
+cinder volumes.
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+Currently, there is no general cache support for block devices in nova, and
+data is stored in the volumes of cinder servers which are attached to the
+compute nodes. This may result in severe bottleneck of I/O performance. To
+address this problem,we propose CacheGroup, which caches data on local storage
+devices of the compute nodes so that they can access data in their local
+cache instead of in the remote cinder servers. Several challenges have to be
+addressed to achieve this goal.
+
+1.  Since compute nodes dynamically attach and release volumes from cinder
+    servers, the cache scheme must support dynamically changing
+    configurations, which supports to freely add and remove volumes.
+2.  The cache scheme for block devices should support different kinds of cache
+    modules (e.g., bcache, dm-cache, flashcache).
+
+Use Cases
+----------
+Cache should be transparent so that users can use the cache in the same way
+that they use the cinder volume.

+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+We implement CacheGroup as a package, and thus some modifications in nova are
+needed to use the caching functionality of CacheGroup.
+
+1.  The cache modules (flashcache, bcache, etc.) should be added to the
+    drivers.
+2.  We need to add a parameter to attach_volume(...) which indicates whether
+    to use cache or not. If the parameter is true, add the volume to cache
+    group after it is attached.
+3.  Nova should setup a database record to indicate which volume is cached.
+4.  When detach a volume, we should remove the cache first.
+5.  To support dynamic addition/removal of volumes, we need to organize the
+    cached volume as a group. Backing devices can be attached and detached
+    at runtime.
+
+CacheGroup is implemented by grouping both the remote storages and the local
+caches. Since we have already implemented this functionality for flashcache,
+we take FlashCacheGroup (fcg) as an example to illustrate the details.
+
+*  Fcg uses dm-linear to create a logical group for remote volumes and combine
+   the local storages (HDDs or SSDs).
+*  Fcg makes cache of the logical volume group using the combined local
+   storage which are called cached group.
+*  When adding a new remote volume to the logical volume group, fcg create a
+   corresponding cached volume out of the cached group using dm-linear.
+*  When removing a volume from the logical volume group, fcg also removes the
+   cached volume accordingly.
+
+CacheGroup can be implemented for other caches (e.g., dm-cache) following the
+same procedure.
+Since bcache itself supports to attach and detach backing devices at runtime,
+we can make bcache and flashcache under the same cache group interface.
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+DM-Cache
+DM-Cache uses I/O scheduling and cache management techniques optimized for
+flash-based SSDs. The device mapper target (DM-Cache) reuses the metadata
+library used in the thin-provisioning library. Both write-back and
+write-through are supported by DM-Cache. The problem of DM-Cache is that its
+metadata device is not easy to handle.
+
+LVM-Cache
+LVM-Cache is built on top of DM-Cache so that logical volumes can be turned
+into cache devices. Because of that, LVM-Cache splits the cache pool LV into
+two devices - the cache data LV and cache metadata LV. LVM-Cache will face
+the same problem with DM-Cache.

+Work Items
+----------
+
+Add configuration options and relevant DB support in nova.
+Add cachegroup implemention code in nova.
+Add unit and integrated tests.
+
+
+Dependencies
