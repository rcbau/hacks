Subject: [PATCH] Add support for QEMU built-in iSCSI initiator

QEMU has built-in iSCSI initiator using libiscsi and Libvirt
can handle it as same as other network storages. This blueprint
adds iSCSI support to Nova's network volume driver
(nova.virt.libvirt.LibvirtNetVolumeDriver).

+Add support for QEMU built-in iSCSI initiator
+=============================================

+
+QEMU has built-in iSCSI initiator using libiscsi and Libvirt can handle it as
+same as other network storages. This blueprint adds iSCSI support to Nova's
+network volume driver (nova.virt.libvirt.LibvirtNetVolumeDriver).
+
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+Nova already has iSCSI volume driver for KVM/QEMU
+(nova.virt.libvirt.LibvirtISCSIVolumeDriver), but iSCSI targets for volumes
+aren't attached to VMs directly but to the host OS of nova-compute nodes. It
+means:
+
+* Storage structure of the host OS will be changed when volumes are attaching
+  to / detaching from VMs on the host. The commands executed by nova-compute to
+  attach/detach volumes are complex. So they may cause confusing storage
+  structure the host OS and make trouble shooting difficult when a problem had
+  occured.
+
+* The host OS have many system logs on attaching/detaching volumes and tons of
+  error logs if a trouble occurs at the iSCSI target or multipath.
+
+* The VMs on a compute node will be stopped when an iSCSI volume is attached or
+  detached to a VM and it causes the host OS crash.
+
+Use Cases
+----------
+
+* Using so many iSCSI-based volumes and attached them to many VMs on a host.
+  Say that up to 50 VMs on a host and up to 20 volumes attached to a VM.  It
+  means that the host OS will handle up to 1k iSCSI targets by itself with
+  LibvirtISCSIVpolumeDriver and the number will be 2x, 3x, or 4x if you use
+  iSCSI multipath capability.
+
+Project Priority
+-----------------
+
+None
+
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+Using KVM/QEMU built-in iSCSI initiator via Libvirt for attaching iSCSI
+volumes. To do so, we have to implement 2 functionality:
+
+* Implement a new libvirt XML configuration handler class named
+  LibvirtConfigSecret. It manages information for iSCSI CHAP authentication.
+
+* Extend LibvirtNetVolumeDriver to support QEMU built-in iSCSI initiator using
+  LibvirtConfigSecret if needed.
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+Just use LibvirtISCSIVolumeDriver.
+
+Data model impact

+---------------------

+None
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+None
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+* QEMU built-in iSCSI initiator doesn't support multipath capability. So VMs
+  will be not able to handle volumes when iSCSI connections die even if the
+  backend iSCSI storage has multipath capability.
+
+* QEMU binary of Ubuntu 14.04 doesn't have iSCSI support. Users have to install
+  libiscsi2 package and libiscsi-dev from Debian and rebuild QEMU binary
+  with libiscsi support by themselves.
+
+Developer impact

+
+Work Items
+----------
+
+Working patches exist, so we have to:
+
+* Implement unit tests.
+* Review the codes.
+
+
+Dependencies
+============
+
+None
+
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+Usually, devstack builds an OpenStack deployment with Cinder using
+LVMISCSIDriver, so we can use it for basic smoke tests. And we should do more
+tests with vendor iSCSI drivers.
+
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+Adding configuration notes to use the driver like below:
+
+To use this, you have to write a parameter at nova.conf:
+
+  volume_drivers = iscsi=nova.virt.libvirt.volume.LibvirtNetVolumeDriver,
+                   iser=nova.virt.libvirt.volume.LibvirtISERVolumeDriver,...
+
+or just
+
+  volume_drivers = iscsi=nova.virt.libvirt.volume.LibvirtNetVolumeDriver
