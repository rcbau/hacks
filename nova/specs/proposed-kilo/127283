Subject: [PATCH] VMware: Native HTML5 consoles for VMware

This is a proposal to add support for the native HTML5 console available in
vSphere 5.5 and later (referred as WebMKS console). This will solve some of the
current problems that we have with VNC consoles with respect to deployment,
scalability and security. The existing support for VNC consoles will remain but
users will be encouraged to use WebMKS when possible.

+Native HTML5 consoles for VMware
+==========================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/vmware-webmks-console
+
+This is a proposal to add support for the native HTML5 console available in
+vSphere 5.5 and later (referred as WebMKS console). This will solve some of the
+current problems that we have with VNC consoles with respect to deployment,
+scalability and security. The existing support for VNC consoles will remain but
+users will be encouraged to use WebMKS when possible.
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+There are number of problems with the current approach which provides VNC
+consoles to instances running on VMware hypervisors:
+
+* Deployment - cloud operators need to open a huge range of ports (5900-6105)
+  in the firewall configuration on each ESXi host. Additionally, they need to
+  create and install a special VIB package for the firewall modifications to
+  persist after reboot. The whole thing creates a huge security risk because
+  we rely only on the fact that all ESXi hosts will run into a private network
+  that will be inaccessible to the cloud users.
+
+* Scalability - the Nova driver needs to allocate a unique VNC port for each
+  instance and this is done by querying all allocated ports on the vCenter
+  while holding a lock in the driver. Needless to say, this doesn't scale well.
+
+* Security - we can prevent race conditions for port allocations occurring on
+  the same nova-compute but there is no way to do this between several
+  nova-computes. This creates a possibility for allocating the same VNC port to
+  different instances and if these instances end up on the same ESXi host
+  somehow, one user can hijack the console of another user.
+
+All of the above problems don't stand with WebMKS consoles.
+
+Use Cases
+----------
+
+Deployers will be able to deploy OpenStack on top of vSphere much more easily
+because they won't need to modify firewall configurations on the ESXi hosts.
+
+Spawning many instances at the same time will be faster for End Users because
+no ports will be allocated in the driver and thus no locks will be held.
+
+Project Priority
+-----------------
+
+None
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+The proposal is to add a new API that will return WebMKS connect information
+similar to how we return connect information for other types of consoles like
+VNC and RDP. The WebMKS connect information for a given instance is the
+following:
+* host - the hostname of the corresponding vCenter
+* port - 7331 or 7343 depending on the type of the web socket (ws or wss)
+* vmId - the Managed Object ID of the virtual machine
+* vmName - the name of the virtual machine
+* vcFQDN - the vCenter Server advanced setting "VirtualCenter.FQDN"
+* sessionTicket - session ticket obtained with the AcquireCloneTicket API
+* thumbprint - the vCenter Server SHA1 SSL thumbprint
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+There is already an existing alternative for instances running on VMware which
+is VNC consoles. We will continue to support this.
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+None
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+We will leverage the new API for getting console access:
+
+Sample request:
+{ "get_console": { "protocol": "webmks" } }
+
+Sample response:
+{ "console": { "protocol": "webmks", "url": "http://example.com:6090/?token=c88be357-0992-40e8-8dd7-afc918ad34d5" } }
+
+The URL in the response points to a WebMKS proxy which authorizes the given
+token by calling nova-consoleauth and then starts proxying between the client
+and the corresponding vCenter server where the instance runs.
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+
+We will use the same security model as for the other types of consoles which is
+leveraging nova-consoleauth to authorize tokens generated by the compute node.
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+
+None
+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+
+None
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+If the VMware driver is configured to provide only WebMKS consoles it will
+perform better because it won't need to allocate any VNC ports (allocating a
+VNC port requires a vCenter query while holding a lock).
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+WebMKS consoles will require deploying WebMKS proxy (similar to
+nova-novncproxy) that will connect compute service users to the corresponsing
+vCenter which provides console access to the given virtual machine.
+
+There will be a new configuration option that will specify the base URL for the
+WebMKS proxy (e.g. webmks_proxy_base_url).
+
+Developer impact
+----------------
+
+None
+
+Implementation

+Primary assignee:
+  rgerganov
+
+Work Items
+----------
+
+The implementation can be split in two parts:
+* add the new API to the compute manager and the virt driver interface
+* implement the new API in the VMware driver
+
+Dependencies
+============
+
+blueprint: consolidate-console-api
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+Since this is a VMware specific feature, VMware NSX CI will be updated to run
+tests that exercise this functionality.
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+The Nova documentation for VMware needs to be updated to say that two types
+of consoles are supported (VNC and WebMKS) and there is no need to modify
+firewall configurations if deployers want to provide only WebMKS.
