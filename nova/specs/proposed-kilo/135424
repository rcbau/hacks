+Cells v2 mapping
+==========================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/cells-v2-mapping
+
+In order for compute api nodes to communicate with cells they will need to have
+knowledge on how to connect to each cell.  A new database and table will be
+created which can store this information for use by the database and RPC layers
+of Nova.
+
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+When Nova is partitioned into cells, the compute api needs to be able to
+communicate with each one via a message bus and a database connection.  There
+is currently no mapping of a cell identifier to a message queue and database
+connection.  And there is no mechanism to dispatch RPC message or database
+queries to different endpoints on a per call basis.
+
+Use Cases
+----------
+
+* Developers who want to make database queries or send RPC messages to a
+  specific cell.
+
+
+Project Priority
+-----------------
+
+Cells v2 has been made a project priority for Kilo.
+
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+The change being proposed is a new database and table for storing a mapping of
+cell to database and message queue.  This is similar to the current cells
+table, but the concepts of weight and is_parent are not needed and a database
+connection is needed.  A new database is being proposed because the new tables
+that will be added to it belong with the compute api layer of Nova, compared to
+some of the current tables which belong in a cells database.  The exact split
+of which information belongs where is an in-progress effort.
+
+Although the weights are being removed here the capability to weight cells will
+be addressed at a later time.
+
+Additionally the database and rpc abstractions in Nova need to be capable of
+communicating with an arbitrary endpoint for every call/query.
+
+There is nothing in place to use this yet so the scope of work ends at just
+having the capability to do it.
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+We could continue to use the nova-cells model in place today.  The downsides of
+this have been described above.
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+A new 'cell_mapping' table will be added.  And it should be added outside of
+the current 'nova' database in a new 'nova_api' database.  This will be
+configurable by a deployer in the same way the current database is configured.
+So while this table could be put into the same database as current tables via
+configuration, it should be made clear that this table is used by different
+services than other current tables.
+
+The table will look approximately like:
+
+CREATE TABLE `cell_mapping` (
+  `created_at` datetime DEFAULT NULL,
+  `updated_at` datetime DEFAULT NULL,
+  `deleted_at` datetime DEFAULT NULL,
+  `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
+  `uuid` varchar(36) NOT NULL,
+  `name` varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,
+  `deleted` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
+  `transport_url` mediumtext NOT NULL,
+  `database_connection` mediumtext NOT NULL)
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+None
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+
+None
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+
+None
+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+
+None
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+On its own this change does not introduce a performance impact.  When it is
+used by later specs it does introduce another database lookup for many actions
+within Nova.  For example a 'nova show <uuid>' will require Nova to look up the
+database that an instance is in before it can query it for instance data.
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+This blueprint introduces the concept of a database that is conceptually
+distinct from the current nova database.  Deployers will need to consider how
+they want to manage a second database, whether it resides on the same host as
+their current nova database or not.
+
+Developer impact
+----------------
+
+This change means that developers should understand that RPC messages or
+database queries may hit one of many endpoints.  At this point it should not
+affect developers work within Nova.  Developers adding future database
+migrations will need to consider whether it goes at the API or cell level and
+add it to the appropriate set of migrations.
+
+
+Implementation
+==============
+
+Assignee(s)
+-----------

+Primary assignee:
+  alaski
+
+Other contributors:
+  None
+
+Work Items
+----------
+
+* Ensure Nova database API can communicate with an arbitrary database on each
+  call.
+
+* Research how to have a separate migration path within Nova for a new
+  database.
+
+* Setup separate database migration path for migrations on a new database.
+
+* Add database migration for 'cell_mapping' table.
+
+
+Dependencies
+============
+
+None
+
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+Since this is designed to be an internal re-architecting of Nova with no user
+visible changes the current suite of Tempest or functional tests should
+suffice.  At some point we will want to look at how to test multiple cells or
+potentially exposing the concept of a cell in the API and we will tackle
+testing requirements then.
+
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+The existence and management of a new database will need to be documented.  It
+is not required that the database be deployed at this time but deployers should
+be prepped on how to start managing it.
