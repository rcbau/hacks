+==========================================
+Refactor of the Neutron network adapter
+==========================================
+
+Include the URL of your launchpad blueprint:
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/nova-neutron-refactor
+
+Through accretion, the Network API adapter for Neutron has become
+prohibitively difficult to maintain, debug and extend. In order to
+improve interoperability of Nova and Neutron, this code must be
+refactored to:
+
+* Make it easier to understand.
+
+* Make it easier to test effectively.
+
+* Encourage extension through acceptable coding and design practices and
+  idioms.
+
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+The majority of Network API adapter is currently contained in
+nova/network/neutronv2/api.py. The principle implementation class is API
+and is direct descendant of `nova.network.base_api.NetworkAPI`. The
+implementation code has some issues:
+
+* The implementation of critical principle methods such as
+  `allocate_for_instance` are large and monolithic including a large number
+  of potential code paths. Besides implementation, this makes it very
+  difficult to create and maintain effective unit tests.
+
+* Data type and organization were simply added to (e.g. adding another
+  element to a tuple) accommodate new requirements as opposed toh
+  refactoring to a more appropriate data structure such as class type.
+
+* While Neutron client API calls are accompanied by try/catch blocks, the
+  Neutron exceptions are not translated to Nova exceptions so they can be
+  immmediately used in calling code. Neutron exceptions permeating the
+  Nova/Neutron boundary obviates the potential for networking backend agnostic
+  code.
+
+* Certain APIs methods have become entry points for logically divergent
+  operations (i.e. candy machine interfaces). This is easily identifiable
+  by the complexity and size of their implementation.
+  `allocate_for_instance` is another good example of this. It has several
+  major forms with divergent code paths: no requested network, requested
+  network by id, requested network by port.
+
+* JSON request bodies for the Neutron REST API tend to be constructed in-place
+  and repeatedly throughout the code (e.g. the port request body in
+  `allocate_for_instance`) This is error prone, difficult and labor intensive
+  to maintain and test. It is also difficult for developers with only passing
+  familiarity with the Neutron API to identify errors and modify code.
+
+.. note::
+
+  Efforts to modify or extend the python neutron client to create a
+  higher level facade to hide REST request body formatting are under
+  discussion.
+
+Use Cases
+----------
+
+As a critical and fundamental API, developers need an implementation that
+is more maintainable and testable. Risk of regressions or non-deterministic
+consequences when extending or repairing the implementation should not be
+disproportionate to the changes being made.
+
+Project Priority
+-----------------
+
+This API implementation carries with it significant technical debt that
+impedes Nova to Neutron migration.
+
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+Resolving the issues requires a major refactoring of the existing Neutron
+implementation of Nova's Network API. The scale and scope of the
+refactoring is large and pervasive and can be interpreted as a rewrite.
+However, the existing implementation and API definition serve as a starting
+point and requirements reference. To mitigate obstacles endemic to
+refactoring the current implementation in-place, the refactor will
+immediately replace the existing API's implementation, initially wholly
+delegating to the existing implementation. Refactorings can then be
+performed *across* the API (e.g. exception mapping, argument conversion),
+per method, or per method use case (e.g. `allocate_for_instance` with no
+requested networks).
+
+Specific proposed refactorings are covered by additional blueprints and
+related by common topic.
+
+In addition to changes to the implementation of the API itself,
+consideration will be given to extending the functionality of the existing
+API methods to accomodate more appropriate behavioral patterns (e.g.
+asynchronous methods).
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+The main alternate approach considered is an ordered, step-wise
+refactoring spread across multiple phases. For example,
+
+* Phase 1: Code cleanup and reorganization and use the Neutron API more
+  efficiently.
+
+* Phase 2: Apply patterns and improve implementation.
+
+* Phase 3: Introduce data model changes and make the API implementation
+  compatible with the existing Nova-Network version.
+
+This is a more classic approach to refactoring and was the approach
+initially considered. After discussion and investigation, any potential
+merits of this approach are outweighed by current realities of
+development on Nova:
+
+* The amount of labor involved in simple refactorings such as "extract
+  method" is dramatically increased by the state of the existing unit
+  tests. The size of a single patch for a single refactor operation
+  (e.g. extract method) would consequently be large. Large changes to
+  the test suite increase the risk of broken tests, increase developer
+  and reviewer burden without reducing risks of new bugs. To mitigate
+  this, larger blocks of code might be modified at a time with a
+  corresponding rewrite of entire blocks of tests - effectively blurring
+  the lines between rewriting and refactoring. This is not without a
+  cost however when considering the factors below.
+
+* An expected benefit of the phased approach are immediate gains in
+  quality. This is primarily in reference to code quality, a developer
+  facing concern, but also general stability and maintainability, which
+  is a more widespread benefit. However, neither the code under
+  modification nor the dependencies are static and there are typically
+  several patches "in-flight" at a given moment. The risks of
+  regressions, source code conflicts, and complexity of tracking down
+  issues balances the benefits of refactoring critical pieces of code.
+
+* Without the larger context of the expected end result, patches are
+  difficult to evaluate. Knowledge of both Nova and Neutron is not
+  commonplace, implying a subset of available core reviewers. The
+  cross-component nature of the code is also an obstacle to "getting
+  good reviews". Patches that include all of the relevant context would
+  be easier to digest and review effectively.
+
+* The phased approach introduces a targeting problem for changes that
+  are currently in-flight or come up during a cycle. Are they introduced
+  as patches against the current code, the refactoring-in-progress code
+  or deferred to post refactoring? The decision would be case specific
+  but any course of action comes with a certain degree of risk. The
+  suggested approach would expect that changes are simply applied to the
+  existing code and have to be ported to the in-flight refactoring. In
+  essence, the changes affect on those working on the refactor.
+
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+There are no planned data model or remotable objects changes at this time and,
+for the sake of this effort, should be avoided. The intent is to provide a drop
+in replacement for the existing implementation. Implementation specific
+alterations to the data model and remotable objects increase the risk and
+complexity of switching between implementations.
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+It is not expected that the REST API will be changed in this
+process. Future changes may be proposed however. The implementation of
+the Compute REST API is expected to change as special cases for Neutron
+configurations will become obsolete.
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+
+None.
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+
+None
+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+
+None
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+None
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+It is expected that additional source files will be created. Deployment
+tools that are not wild card based in file selection will need to be
+modified to include the new files.
+
+
+Developer impact
+----------------
+
+Developers working with the existing code will be lightly impacted by
+incremental patches that land during the refactoring process. These patches
+primarily impact the Network API and its consumers as the existing
+implementation is adapted to match improvements in parameters and return
+values
+
+
+Implementation
+==============
+
+Assignee(s)
+-----------
+
+Brent Eagles (beagles@redhat.com) is leading the refactoring of this
+code in this phase.
+
+One or more sponsors from the core teams should have direct involvement
+in an, at minimum, advisory capacity. Particularly:
+
+* Dan Smith - Nova: objects, data model and migration.
+* Matt Riedemann
+* (interested neutron cores?)
+
+
+Primary assignee:
+* Brent Eagles  beagles@redhat.com
+
+
+Work Items
+----------
+
+1. Create repeatable profiling test cases for common use cases.
+2. Verify and extend Nova network API tempest tests. Test changes and
+   additions are covered within the specific refactor specifications.
+3. Construct and verify new API implementation
+
+
+Dependencies
+============
+
+None.
+
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+A CI job will be added to the experimental work queue to run Tempest with
+the new implementation in place.
+
+Additional functional tests may be required to provide sufficient rigor
+for validating the new implementation.
+
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+The refactored implementation will appear as an additional network
+back-end API until such time that it can replace the current API
+implementation. A configuration to select the alternate implementation
+will need documentation.
