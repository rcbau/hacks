Subject: [PATCH] Add the docker hypervisor plugin to Nova

By adding this plugin back to the Nova source tree, we will enable
operators to use docker containers in OpenStack with full scheduling.

As of the Icehouse release, the nova-docker hypervisor plugin was
removed as many of the Tempest tests were failing. Many of the tests
were failing due to missing APIs in docker and subsequently missing
functionality in the plugin.  There has been significant progress
implementing those missing features and fixing various bugs associated
with the already existing features. As a result we now have extensive
Tempest test coverage.

+Add the docker hypervisor plugin to Nova

+
+By adding this plugin back to the Nova source tree, we will enable operators to
+use docker containers in OpenStack with full scheduling.
+
+As of the Icehouse release, the nova-docker hypervisor plugin was removed as
+many of the Tempest tests were failing. Many of the tests were failing due
+to missing APIs in docker and subsequently missing functionality in the plugin.
+There has been significant progress implementing those missing features and
+fixing various bugs associated with the already existing features. As a result
+we now have extensive Tempest test coverage.
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+A detailed description of the problem:
+
+Docker hypervisor plugin is useful to OpenStack operators in that it plugs into
+the compute design quite nicely. Implementing container management as a
+hypervisor plugin allows the use of container placement via the scheduler. It
+also allows the implementation of many Nova APIs without having a separate set
+of command line tools or APIs.
+
+Docker has features which don't make obvious sense to expose via the Nova API.
+These include resizing images, suspend/resume, rescue, and migrations.
+
+Docker (and containers in general) also have features which we may wish to
+consider supporting by creating a specialized container service.  However, this
+is not within the scope of this proposal.
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+The proposal is that we move the stackforge/nova-docker directory, which
+contains all the code for the docker hypervisor plugin into the
+openstack/nova/nova/virt source directory along side the rest of the hypervisor
+plugins shipped with Nova.
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+Several alternatives exist to work around not having native Docker container
+management in OpenStack. They are as follows:
+
+* Get the nova-docker hypervisor plugin from stackforge and configure Nova to
+  use it.
+
+* Introduce a new container service in OpenStack that is completely independent
+  of Nova APIs and is soley focused on container capabilities.
+
+* Disregard the capabilities added to OpenStack via docker support with scheduler
+  support.
+
+* Not include Docker container management in OpenStack at all.
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+None
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+None
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+
+None
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+
+None
+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+
+* The user (Operator) will be able to use the standard Nova APIs and command
+  line tools to manage docker containers.
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+* Containers allow lightweight instances to be started very fast.  They also
+  consume fewer resources on the host machine.
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+* The Docker hypervisor plugin will become easier to configure. The
+  configuration settings already exist in nova.conf to use the Docker
+  hypervisor plugin, the only change here is that the plugin code would be
+  installed with the rest of the hypervisor plugins.
+
+* The Docker plugin will be better maintained and integration testing can
+  be run on all nova changes ensuring ongoing functionality and development.
+
+* One could deploy nova compute instances within VMs allowing you to
+  distribute containers across a multitude of VMs and scale accordingly.
+
+Developer impact
+----------------
+
+* There would be added consideration in future development to support
+  containers.
+
+Implementation
+==============
+
+* The stackforge code needs to be placed in the Nova source tree
+
+* Volume Attach and Detach - The API for adding and removing a device to Docker
+  is missing. There is currently a patch set posted for review, which adds
+  the capability to attach and detach a host device to a running docker
+  container. Additionally, the implementation in the hypervisor plugin has
+  been added to call the Docker API to add/remove a device to/from a container.
+  This will be merged once the Docker API has been merged.
+
+* Security considerations - Some operations within containers are considered
+  potentially threatening to the host machine.  Container technology itself is
+  not considered entirely secure and having multiple tenants operating on the
+  same hardware may be a potential security issue.

+
+Work Items
+----------
+
+* Copy the stackforge/nova-docker source code into nova/nova/virt.
+* Continue adding the ability to support more Openstack features, including
+  volume support etc.
+
+Dependencies
+============
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+* There are unit tests in place in the code base.
+
+* We currently run full integration tests on both Ubuntu and Fedora with each
+  commit.  The Tempest configuration has a number of tests that don't apply to
+  containers that need to be turned off. The settings we are currently turning
+  off are: volume, resize, suspend, swift, rescue, cinder, and migrate.  Volume
+  support is being actively worked on.
+
+* A recent run of our Tempest coverage resulted in the following statistics:
+        Run: 1726 in 2750.246079 sec.
+        Passed: 1530
+        Skipped: 196
+        Failed: 0
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+The docs team would need to add the Docker hypervisor plugin details back to
+the docs, listing the availability of the driver and the module name to set as
+the compute_driver value to have Nova load the driver.
