+Enforce unique instance uuid in data model
+==========================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/enforce-unique-instance-uuid-in-db
+
+The instances.uuid column in the data model is not unique but by definition a
+UUID should be unique, and given how it's used within nova and across other
+openstack services like glance, neutron, ceilometer, etc, it should be unique.
+
+Furthermore, there are Foreign Keys created against instances.uuid so it should
+be unique.
+
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+* Uniqueness for instances.uuid is not enforced in the data model.
+
+* There are foreign keys created on the instances.uuid column so it should be
+  unique.
+
+Use Cases
+----------
+
+As a DB2 user (deployer), I'd like to have the same foreign key constraints
+with my DB2 Nova schema as MySQL and PostgreSQL.
+
+Project Priority
+-----------------
+
+None, however, this is required for DB2 support in Nova.
+
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+Add a database migration that checks for existing records where the
+instances.uuid or related instance_uuid column is NULL and if found, fails the
+migration until those are deleted.
+
+A tool will be provided to scan the database for these records and list them,
+then prompt the user to delete them.  A --force option could also be provided
+in the tool to ignore any prompts and just delete the records if found.
+
+The new migration would be blocked until the records are deleted.  Once there
+are no records left, the migration will make those columns non-nullable via
+SQLAlchemy and create a UniqueConstraint on the instances.uuid column.
+
+Note that the fixed_ips table is the exception here since it can, by design,
+contain NULL instance_uuid records to indicate deallocated and disassociated
+fixed IPs.
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+Do nothing and leave the nova objects layer to enforce unique instance uuid
+entries, but this does not help with the foreign key issue in the data model.
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+#. NULL instances.uuid/instance_uuid records must be deleted, except in table
+   fixed_ips as described above.
+#. The instances.uuid column will be made non-nullable.
+#. A UniqueConstraint will be created on the instances.uuid column.
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+None.
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+
+None.
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+
+None.
+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+
+None.
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+The only performance impact on existing deployments is in the migration
+script changes which would be tested with turbo-hipster.
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+The main impacts to deployers are:
+
+#. The biggest impact is the new migration. Migrations are potentially slow and
+   require the controller service to be down when run.
+#. The hope is that existing deployments are not carrying records where
+   instances.uuid or instance_uuid are None so the NULL queries in the new
+   migration script would not yield large result sets. However, the impact to
+   the deployer here is that they would be forced to manually prune those
+   records before the migration can continue. Note that it's expected that
+   those cases are exceptional and they are only the result of an inconsistent
+   database. So finding these records is not expected, but if it is a problem
+   the migration will fail clearly with instructions on how to fix the problem.
+
+Developer impact
+----------------
+
+None.

+Implementation

+
+Assignee(s)
+-----------
+
+Primary assignee:
+  mriedem@us.ibm.com
+
+Work Items
+----------
+
+#. Add a new migration to make instances.uuid non-nullable and put a unique
+   constraint on that column.
+#. Write a tool to check for null instance_uuid records within the database
+   for operators to use before the actual migration.
+
+See the WIP patch for details: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/97946/
+
+
+Dependencies
+============
+
+None.
+
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+* Unit tests for the new database migration will be added to stub a database
+  with NULL instance_uuid records to make sure the migration fails when those
+  records are found and then test that when they are removed, the migration
+  completes successfully and the unique constraint is created. Similarly the
+  downgrade path will be unit tested.
+* Unit tests will also be written for the scan tool used to run outside of the
+  actual database migrations. This will mock out the backend database but will
+  be used to test the CLI and logic.
+* It is expected that turbo-hipster will cover scale testing the new migration
+  for MySQL.
+
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+None.
