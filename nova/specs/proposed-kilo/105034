+Keypair support for X509 public key certificates
+================================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/keypair-x509-certificates
+
+Introduction of X509 public key certificates keypair support in the Nova API.
+
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+Nova keypairs are mostly used by Linux guests to handle user authentication via
+SSH public key authentication without incurring in the management and security
+overhead that passwords require.
+
+Public keys are provided to the guests as part of the metadata and included in
+the guest configuration by tools like cloud-init.
+
+Windows operating systems don't support natively SSH and thus authentication
+requires the usage of passwords unless the image deployer chooses to include a
+3rd party unsupported SSH service port, which implies incurring in potential
+security and support issues.
+
+Windows supports natively password-less authentication for WinRM by using X509
+certificates in place of SSH keys, including PowerShell remoting as detailed
+here: http://www.cloudbase.it/windows-without-passwords-in-openstack/
+
+From a practical perspective, X509 certificates are used by WinRM in a way
+which can be considered consistent with the usage of SSH keys on Linux, as
+both are based on public / private keypairs. For simplicity, since WinRM can be
+configured to accept self signed certificates, we will omit the implications of
+certificate chain validation.
+
+Use Cases
+----------
+
+End User will be able to connect to a Windows instance without requiring a
+password.

+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+While Nova currently supports SSH keypairs only, the API can be extended to
+support x509 certificates, while maintaining full backwards compatibility.
+
+The areas that require changes are:
+
+* Nova API (v2 and v3), to accept the certificate type as an option (defaulting
+  to SSH if not provided)
+* The nova.compute.api.KeypairAPI class to be able to generate and manage X509
+  certificates beside the existing SSH case
+* nova.objects.Keypair class to add a type property
+* Related database migration
+* Nova metadata API to support an additional x509 content in
+  nova.api.metadata.base.InstanceMetadata()
+* python-novaclient to add the optional keypair type option
+
+Usage examples
+
+Generating an x509 keypair via CLI and saving the private certificate locally
+(in PKCS#12 format):
+
+    nova keypair-add keypair1 --keypair-type x509
+
+Importing an x509 public key certificate:
+
+    nova keypair-add keypair1 --keypair-type x509 --pub-key \
+    /path/to/PEM_encoded_public_certificate
+
+The certificate type could be discovered by examining the content without
+requiring the user to provide it explicitly.
+
+For backwards compatibility, omitting the certificate type results in a SSH
+certificate:
+
+    nova keypair-add keypair2 --pub-key /path/to/SSH_pub_key
+
+equivalent to:
+
+    nova keypair-add keypair2 --keypair-type SSH --pub-key /path/to/SSH_pub_key
+
+On the metadata side ssh keys and x509 keys are provided separately for
+backwards compatibility:
+
+"public_keys": {"keypair2": "ssh-rsa AAAAB3...cyJvOQ== Generated by Nova\n"},
+"x509": {"keypair1": "MIIDaTC...ysk8w==\n"},
+
+The -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- / -----END CERTIFICATE----- header and footer
+can be omitted
