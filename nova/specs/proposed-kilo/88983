+Persist scheduler hints
+===========================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/persist-scheduler_hints
+
+The aim of this feature is to persist scheduler_hints when creating
+VM instance so that the scheduler hints can be available for the whole
+VM life cycle.
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+Scheduler hints will only take effect at instance deploying time. Later on
+when an admin tries to migrate the instance, there is no way to know if the
+instance is violated their original scheduling policy.
+
+Use Cases
+---------
+
+When resize/migrate/live_migrate/rebuild/evacuate instance, the instance
+still follow the orignal scheduling policy.
+
+Project Priority
+----------------
+
+This feature is valuable for scheduler and user, although it's not part of
+global effort. But it really need a way to make instance obey the scheduling
+hints that assign when deploying.
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+The proposed solution is to store scheduler_hints so that it can be available
+for the whole life cycle of the VM instance.
+
+* Persist scheduler_hints after deploying instance.
+* Add scheduler_hints when show the detail of instance.
+* resize/rebuild/evacuate/migrate/live_migrate honor the persistent scheduler-
+  hints.
+
+The scheduler hints will be stored in new column of instance_extra table when
+create db entry for new instance, that's also before scheduling. It it will be
+populated from db directly, then pass to the scheduler.
+
+When resize/rebuild/evacuate/migrate/live_migrate, the instance will be honor
+the persisted scheduler-hints.
+
+If Admin user specified a host when evacuate/live_migrate, conductor should
+add specifed host into scheduler parameter 'force_hosts' in filter_properties,
+then scheduler will try to match the specifed host with scheduler_hints. If
+the specifed host didn't match with persisted scheduler_hints, the migration
+will failed.
+
+The detail of what happened for instance in a server group as below:
+
+Affinity server group:
+* evacuate/live_migrate without specified host, the scheduling always failed.
+* evacuate/live_migrate with specified host, scheduling always successful.
+* resize/migrate will scheduling successful when enable
+'allow_resize/migrate_to_same_host'.
+* rebuild will schedule successful on same host.
+
+To implement the case of evacuate/live_migrate with specified host, it need
+add specifed host into scheduler parameter 'group_hosts' in filter_properties.
+
+Anti-Affinity server group:
+* resize/migrate/rebuild can't scheduling successful to same host.
+* evacuate/live_migrate always scheduling successful.
+
+If the admin user want to move all the instances in a server group out of a
+server by evacuate/live_migration, admin should doing as below:
+
+* If Admin want to move all the instances in a server group out of a server
+  by evacuate, Admin can specfied a host for first instance, then migrate
+  other instances without specfied, the scheduler will try to move thoses
+  instance to affinity with first instance.
+* If Admin want to move all the instances in a server group with affinity
+  policy out of a server by live migration, Admin should set the service
+  disabled on the source host. Then operate as the way evacuate instance
+  described above.
+
+NOTE: The race problem of migration with server-group will be fixed in another
+spec.
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+Storing the scheduler hints in the instance system metadata is inefficiently,
+and should be moved to being stored as a blob in an appropriate place
+per-instance. The better way is store in instance_extra table.
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+The instance_extra table would have a new 'scheduler_hints' column of
+type Text.
+
+Also add a new 'scheduler_hints' field to `nova.object.instance.Instance`
+object, as type `fields.DictOfStringsField`. That field would be populated
+on-demand.
+
+The database migration for this change will be add the new column.
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+This propose will add change to API v2 and v2.1. For v2 API, there would
+be an new extension 'extend_scheduler_hints'. For v2.1 API, it would be
+add to scheduler_hints directly.
+
+The scheduler_hints' json-schema as below::
+
+    schedule_hints_schema = {
+        'type': 'object',
+        'properties': {
+            'group': {
+                'type': 'string', 'maxLength': 255,
+            },
+            'different_host': {
+                'type': ['string', 'array'],
+                'format': 'uuid',
+                'items': parameter_types.server_id
+            },
+            'same_host': {
+                'type': ['string', 'array'],
+                'items': parameter_types.server_id
+            },
+            'query': {
+                'type': ['string', 'object'],
+            },
+            'target_cell': parameter_types.name,
+            'build_near_host_ip': {
+                'type': 'string',
+                'oneOf': [
+                    {'format': 'ipv4'},
+                    {'format': 'ipv6'}
+                ],
+            },
+            'cidr': {
+                'type': 'string',
+                'pattern': '^\/[0-9a-f.:]+$'
+            },
+        },
+        'additionalProperties': False
+    }
+
+The change of nova REST API as below (all the changes is same with v2 and
+v2.1):
+
+* Extend the response of server's show::
+
+    {
+        'type': 'object',
+        'properties': {
+            'server': {
+                'type': 'object',
+                'properties': {
+                    ...
+                    'OS-SCH-HNT:scheduler_hints': schedule_hints_schema,
+                    ...
+                },
+                'additionalProperties': False,
+            },
+        },
+        'required': ['server'],
+        'additionalProperties': False,
+    }
+
+The output of scheduler_hints use the policy rule: admin_or_owner.
+
+If Admin user specifed a host when evacuate/live_migrate, and the specifed
+host didn't match the persisted scheduler_hints, the REST API will return
+BadRequest(400).
