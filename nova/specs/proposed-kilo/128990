+=====================================================
+Parallels Cloud Server support in nova/libvirt driver
+=====================================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/pcs-support
+
+This specification is intended to describe process of extending nova/libvirt
+driver in order to support Parallels Cloud Server [1]
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+Parallels Cloud Server (PCS) is a virtualization solution product, which
+enables service providers to use container and hypervisor virtualization
+technology via the same management tools and API.
+Though PCS is supported by libvirt it is absent in OpenStack for now due to
+not only specific demand related to compute node deployment but also
+different disk image format implied by usage of Parallels disk loopback block
+device [2], domains configuration and supported features.
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+To make PCS be supported by OpenStack we need to modify a bit
+nova/libvirt driver mostly regarding a new type of virtualization processing.
+The end user will be able to configure nova to use PCS by setting
+libvirt.virt_type option to either to "vzct" - for containers or "vzhyp" for
+hypervisor based instances. Also as a native disk format for both VMs and
+containers in PCS is ploop [2] to get best performance user will need to
+configure glance-api configuration to support PCS ploop format.
+
+nova.conf extract example:
+[libvirt]
+...
+virt_type = vzct
+images_type = ploop
+...
+
+glance-api.conf extract example:
+...
+disk_formats=ami,ari,aki,vhd,vmdk,raw,qcow2,vdi,iso,ploop
+...
+
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+The alternate way is to implement a separate PCS nova driver like this one[3],
+which was implemented in terms of PCS + OpenStack proof of concept.
+
+pros:
+* There is no middle layer between OpenStack and PCS as pcs-nova-driver uses
+native PCS's python API.
+* Changes in pcs-nova-driver will not affect nova/libvirt's code.
+
+cons:
+* Yet another nova driver
+* It is out-of-tree driver
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+None.
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+None.
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+
+None.
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+
+None.
+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+
+None.
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+None.
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+Compute nodes available for "vzct" or "vzhyp" type of instances have to be
+deployed with the help of PCS installer.
+
+Developer impact
+----------------
+
+None.

+
+Work Items
+----------
+* Enhance libvirt driver to support new virt_type value.
+* Add support of new disk image format in glance
+* Implement all the functionality necessary to support PCS in libvirt driver
+* To be specified
+
+Dependencies
+============
+
+None
+
+Testing
+=======
+Testing in the gate will be provided by currently being established Parallels
+CI testing system.
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+New type of virtualization provider should be noticed and host deployment
+pre-requisites such as the need to have PCS installed on compute nodes.
