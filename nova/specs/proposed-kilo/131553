Subject: [PATCH] Isolate scheduler DB for Instance Groups

Identifies work needed in the scheduler and nova code to eliminate DB
access by scheduler when filtering on instance group hints. This is one
part of preparing for the scheduler forklift.

+============================================
+Isolate Scheduler Database - Instance Groups
+============================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/isolate-scheduler-db
+
+We want to split out nova-scheduler into  a separate service named 'gantt'. To
+do this, this blueprint is the second stage after scheduler-lib split. These
+two blueprints are independent however.
+
+In this blueprint, we propose passing all of the information regarding instance
+groups to the scheduling request so that the scheduler doesn't have to access
+the database.
+
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+Currently the scheduler only receives the name of an instance group in the form
+of a scheduler hint. It must then get the corresponding InstanceGroup object in
+order to get the hosts in that group and its affinity/anti-affinity policy, and
+that involves DB calls. We propose having Nova pass the necessary information
+about the InstanceGroup directly in the request if it is needed, rather than
+just the name.
+
+
+Use Cases
+----------
+
+N/A, this is a refactoring effort.
+
+Project Priority
+-----------------
+
+The kilo priorities list is currently not defined. However under the currently
+proposed list of priorities it would fall under "Scheduler split" and
+"Technical Debt".
+
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+In order to remove the necessity for the scheduler to access the db to make
+filtering decisions, nova would update the scheduler regularly with Instance
+Group information, which would be stored by the scheduler. This information
+would have to also include the policy (affinity, anti-affinity, etc.), so that
+the scheduler could filter appropriately based on the type of request.
+
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+The above proposal requires changes to nova and scheduler to initially populate
+and regularly maintain the information about Instance Groups in the scheduler.
+Another approach would be for nova to ensure that the request passes in all the
+information about Instance Groups that the scheduler would need. This would
+include:
+
+  * The Instance Group UUID
+  * A list of acceptable host UUIDs
+
+The scheduler can then filter based on the list of hosts without having to make
+any calls to the db.
+
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+None. There is no extra information to persist, as we will provide extra
+required data for filters either in request_spec or filter_properties, or
+direcly update HostState.
+
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+None
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+
+None
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+
+None
+
+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+
+None
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+Possibly some small increase in performance due to fewer db calls, but this
+should be minimal.
+
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+None
+
+Developer impact
+----------------
+
+Ideally:
+
+* Filters should no longer place calls to other bits of code except Scheduler.
+  This will be done by modifying Scheduler component to proxy conductor calls
+  to a Singleton which will refuse anything but scheduler-related objects.
+  See footnote [1] as example. As said above, we will still provide a failback
+  mode for Kilo release in order to have compatibility with N-1 release.
