Subject: [PATCH] SRIOV scheduling with stateless offloads

This feature will add support for the consideration of PCI
device HW offload capabilities during guest placement. The
user can request PCI network device offload functionality
for their guest, this feature will enable the placement of
the guest on a compute node that provides these capabilities.

+SRIOV scheduling with stateless offloads
+==========================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/sriov-sched-with-stateless-offloads
+
+There is a per packet overhead associated with the processing of ethernet based
+packets, examples of this are packet checksum generation, protocol segmentation
+mechanisms and vlan tagging. Without hardware support this work has to be done
+by the operating system.
+
+Modern network controllers (NIC) can offload some of this processing to
+hardware residing on the NIC which reduces the work load of the operating
+system of the host platform. The benefits of offloading the packet processing
+overhead to hardware are reduced CPU utilisation and network latencies
+resulting in a more efficient packet processing system.
+
+Virtual machines can also benefit from NIC hardware offloads available on the
+host platform. When a virtual manchine is bound to an SRIOV physical or virtual
+function they can avail of the hardware offload capabilities of the NIC on the
+host platform. This reduces the workload of the operating system in the guest
+and reduces traffic on the PCI bus of the host platform as data to be sent over
+the NIC can be transferred in large chunks instead of smaller protocol defined
+packets.
+
+Guests that run NFV type workloads often have performance thresholds they must
+work within. When a guest requires NIC offloads, its important that the guest
+is scheduled to run on a compute node that provides these NIC offloads.
+
+This blueprint will add the following support to Openstack:
+
+* Enable libvirt discover the offload capabilities of PCI devices on compute
+  nodes.
+
+* Enable resource tracker monitor the availability of PCI device offloads.
+
+* Enhance the scheduling/filtering mechanism to ensures that a guest with NIC
+  offload  requirements is scheduled to run on a compute node NIC that provides
+  the required offloads.
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+Modern NIC's have the ability to offload some of the network stack processing
+to hardware. This is important in high speed networks where processing overhead
+of the network stack becomes significant.
+
+Some of the NIC offloads of interest here are:
+* TCP segmentation (TSO)
+* IP, TCP and UDP checksums
+* VLAN tagging
+
+Certain guest workloads rely on the performance advantages of using NIC
+offloads to perform to an optimum or stay within certain performance
+thresholds.
+
+Currently Openstack is not aware of the NIC offload attributes of its compute
+nodes, or it doesn't consider a guests NIC offload requirements during guest
+placement.
+
+This feature aims to add support to Openstack so that it can discover the NIC
+offload attributes of its compute nodes. And when NIC offload capabilities are
+requested by the user, provide intelligent guest placement on a compute node
+that provides the required NIC offload capabilities.
+
+Use Cases
+----------
+
+A guest running network intensive workloads requires certain NIC offloads in
+order to perform to an optimum. Currently Openstack doesn't consider the
+offload capabilities provided by the host during the scheduling/filtering
+phase. This means, a guest that requires offloads could be scheduled to run on
+a host that doesn't provide these offloads, resulting in non optimal
+performance.
+
+With this feature, the user can request certain NIC offloads for their guests,
+Openstack will then determine what NIC offloads are available on its compute
+nodes and place a guest on a compute node that fulfils the guests requirements.
+
+Project Priority
+-----------------
+
+Performance.
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+Libvirt config will be modified to use the NIC offload attributes discovered
+when gathering the available resources.
+
+The user can request PCI device offloads for their guest using the image
+properties. The offload properties will then be translated into pci
+requests. This gives the user the opportunity to tune their custom image for
+optimal performance.
+
+The properties in the image will be matched against sriov ports specified in
+--nics. The format will allow specifying different properties for different
+ports.
+
+E.g
+    glance image-update <IMAGE> --property sriov-nic-caps.0=rx,tx,tso
+
+    glance image-update <IMAGE> --property sriov-nic-caps.1=rx,tx
+
+
+The list of HW offload attributes will be stored in PCI device extra_info, this
+will consist of a comma separated string.
+
+create_pci_requests_for_sriov_ports() will be modified to support the new pci
+network device offload requests.
+
+nova/pci/stats.py will be modified to manage the new PCI network device offload
+attributes.
+
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+None
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+The PCI device model will be extended to add a list of HW offload attributes.
+
+A migration script will be provided to support the new PCI device model.
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+None
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+
+None
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+
+None
+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+
+The tenant will be able to request NIC offloads for a certain image via the
+image properties.
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+This feature will ensure that a guest with certain NIC offloads requirements
+will be scheduled on a compute node that provides these features. This will
+optimise the workloads of a guest running intensive workloads.
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+None

+Work Items
+----------
+
+* Add support to libvirt, that enables the discovery and xml representation of
+  the offload capabilities of PCI devices on the compute platform.
+
+* Update libvirt config to support the management of new PCI device offload
+  data attribute..
+
+* The PCI model will be extended with a list to describe the PCI devicesi
+  offload.
+
+* The PCI passthrough filter will be modified to include the checking of the
+  device offload.
+
+Dependencies
+============
+
+This feature depends on the extra functionality proposed for libvirt. See
+references section for more detail.
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+UT will be added for this feature.
+Third party tests will be run on real multi NIC HW, examples scenarios:
+
+Using multi NIC platform, disable certain offloads on specific NICs.
+Request certain NIC offloads via image properties.
+Boot guest, verify its associated with NIC exposing requested offloads.
+
+Using multi NIC platform, disable certain offloads on all NICs.
+Request certain NIC offloads via image properties.
+Boot guest, verify guest fails to boot.
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+If required, documentation will be added to describe the use of image
+properties for PCI device offload capabilities.
