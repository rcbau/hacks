Subject: [PATCH] Add spec for 'Failover to alternative iSCSI portals on login
 failure'

When the main iSCSI portal is unreachable by network failure etc.,
volume attach/detach will fail even though the other portal addresses
is reachable. To enable nova-compute to fail-over to alternative portal
addresses, cinder will tell the alternative portal addresses to nova.
When alternative portal addresses are provided, nova should handle them.

+Failover to alternative iSCSI portals on login failure
+======================================================
+
+Include the URL of your launchpad blueprint:
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/iscsi-alternative-portal
+
+This spec proposes to add fail-over feature to alternative iSCSI portals on
+attaching iSCSI volumes when the main iSCSI portal is unaccessible.
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+When the main iSCSI portal is unreachable by network failure etc., volume
+attach/detach will fail even though the other portal addresses is reachable.
+Cinder-spec to add the alternative portal addresses in 'connection_info' is
+proposed. When nova failed to login to the main portal, it should fail-over
+to the alternative portals.
+
+Use Cases
+---------
+
+This proposal is useful to improve availability of volume operations by
+enable cloud users to attach/detach iSCSI volumes during the main portal
+failure.
+
+Project Priority
+----------------
+
+None
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+Cinder will add optional parameters 'target_alternative_portals',
+'target_alternative_iqns', and 'target_alternative_luns' into 'connection_info'
+returned by initialize_connection volume action API, that represents a list
+of alternative addresses of the iSCSI portals and the corresponding iqn and lun
+to each portal. (iqns and luns can be the same when the addresses are pointing
+the same portal.)
+
+When nova-compute recognizes these parameters, it should fail-over to
+the alternative portal address/target/lun specified by the parameters on
+login failure to the main portal.
+
+Note that this proposal is for single iSCSI data path use-case, which is
+applied in the case CONF.libvirt.iscsi_use_multipath = False.
+Multiple data path (multipath) use-case should be covered with another spec.
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+None
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+None.
+
+Note that 'connection_info' JSON string with new parameters are stored in the
+table 'block_device_mapping', but it doesn't require changes of schema.
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+None
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+
+None
+
+Note that if any CHAP credentials are provided in connection_info, they must
+be applied on the all target_portals.
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+
+None
+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+
+None
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+None
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+None
+
+Developer impact

+- Implement this feature in Cinder
+- Modify nova and brick library to fail-over to alternative portals
+
+Dependencies
+============
+
+None
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+- Unit tests for connect_volume/disconnect_volume for iSCSI volumes should be
+  added to check if they can handle response from initialize_connection volume
+  API with and without new parameters.

+Documentation Impact
