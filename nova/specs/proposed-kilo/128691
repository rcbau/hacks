Subject: [PATCH] VMware:  Support multi disk images in OVA container format

When OVA support for VMware is added, this spec proposes to follow on with
adding the support for OVA images that contain multiple disk images.

+VMware OVA multidisk support
+==========================================
+
+Include the URL of your launchpad blueprint:
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/vmware-driver-ova-multidisk-support
+
+This blueprint proposes to follow on from the VMware OVA support blueprint
+(https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/vmware-driver-ova-support) and
+add support for multiple disks contained within the OVA.
+
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+An OVA is a tar file that can contain multiple files.  Very often an OVA image
+can contain multiple disks (multiple .vmdk files contained in the OVA).
+
+The OVA support blueprint is assuming that each OVA will contain only 1 vmdk.
+This proposal is to extend the OVA support code by allowing support for
+multiple vmdk files in the OVA.
+
+Use Cases
+----------
+
+The end user will be able to import an OVA image into OpenStack as per the
+VMware OVA support blueprint
+(https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/vmware-driver-ova-support), but
+now when the OVA image contains multiple disk images, the nova boot (spawn)
+will create a VMware VM that uses all the disks contained in the OVA file.
+
+Project Priority
+-----------------
+
+None
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+The VMware OVA support blueprint already will look at the OVF file in the OVA
+to do some minimal processing.  This will be extended if necessary to determine
+the order the disks will be attached to the VM.  This is required to ensure
+that the VM boots off the correct .vmdk contained in the OVA.
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+* It may be possible to modify the image itself within glance to support
+  multiple image files. This however would require a big change to the
+  glance model.
+
+  * Note that the VMware OVA support blueprint may address this which would
+    influence how this blueprint handles images that contain multiple files.
+
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+None
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+None
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+
+None
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+
+None
+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+
+A user will be able to make use of OVA images that contain multiple disks
+so that virtual machines deployed from the image will make use of all disks
+contained in the OVA.
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+Note that multiple disk images mean that the image itself has more .vmdk files,
+so this will have an effect on initial virtual machine spawn time when
+vmdk files are copied.  The extra time required to attach more disks to a
+virtual machine will be minimal.
+
+Other deployer impact

+
+Work Items
+----------
+
+* Instead of taking just the one vmdk from the image at spawn time, if there
+  are multile .vmdk files referenced in the OVF and present in the image,
+  each one will need to be copied into the datastore cache location.
+
+* At spawn time, loop through and attach each vmdk to the VM instead of just
+  one (OVF file may need to be referenced to determine order and number of
+  disks)
+
+* Optimization - If the image itself already exists in the datastore cache
+  location, it should be possible to copy the ovf file from the datastore cache
+  itself, rather than downloading the entire OVA from glance and extracting it.
+  This would speed up deploys greatly after the 1st deploy that uses a
+  particular datastore. Note this may require modifications to the code to
+  copy the ovf to the datastore cache location instead of just the disk file.
+
+
+Dependencies
+============
+
+* This blueprint will extend the work done by the VMware OVA support blueprint:
+  https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/vmware-driver-ova-support
+
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+Similar to what is proposed in the parent blueprint
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/vmware-driver-ova-support, this
+blueprint proposes to update the `VMware NSX CI <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki
+/NovaVMware/Minesweeper>`_ with additional tests to verify spawning of
+instances using OVA images that contain multiple disk files.  This is because
+tempest doesn't support driver specific tests.
+
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+New information in the vmware driver sectino of the Nova documentation will
+need to be updated to document how to specify multiple disks in the .ovf file
+contained with in the OVA image, and to indicate that multidisk OVA images
+are supported.
