+=============================================
+Add support for InfiniBand SR-IOV VIF Driver
+=============================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/vif-driver-ib-passthrough
+
+Adding support for InfiniBand SR-IOV vif type allows Virtual PCI device (VF)
+to be directly mapped to the guest, allowing higher performance
+and advanced features such as RDMA (remote direct memory access).
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+Till Juno Release (including) InfiniBand (IB) SR-IOV networking was possible
+via out of the tree nova vif driver with neutron Mellanox Ml2 Mechanism Driver.
+Since Juno Ethernet SR-IOV device vNIC is supported by nova, and may be
+leveraged for IB SR-IOV device.
+IB SR-IOV vif plugging logic should be added to LibvirtGenericVIFDriver.
+
+Use Cases
+----------
+
+InfiniBand (IB) is popular, open standard, high performance and
+extreme efficiency interconnect protocol. To enable Big Data, High Performance
+Computing (HPC) and other similar use cases the guest requires direct access
+to IB NIC device.
+
+Project Priority
+-----------------
+
+None
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+This change adds vif_driver support for vif_type  VIF_TYPE_IB_HOSTDEV
+as part of the GenericLibvirtVifDriver.
+Currently, there is no standard API to set InfiniBand vGuid (equivalent for
+Ethernet mac address), therefor special driver utility will be used to set it.
+This utility is already used in case of mlnx_direct vif_type.
+
+In the neutron VIF_TYPE_HOSTDEV is already supported by ML2 Mellanox
+Mechanism Drivert and enables networking configuration of SR-IOV Virtual
+Functions on IB Fabric. The vif_type name should be renamed to
+VIF_TYPE_IB_HOSTDEV to indicate specific InfiniBand vif_type.
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+Currently there is no valid alternative.
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+None
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+None
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+
+Execution of the dedicated 'ebrctl' utility requires the use of sudo.
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+
+None
+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+
+None
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+None
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+To use this feature the deployer must use Infiniband enabled network adapters.
+Infiniband Subnet Manager should be running to enable IB Fabric.
+The 'ebrctl' utility should be installed on compute nodes.
+
+Deployers need to be aware of the limitations:
+* There will be no smooth upgrade path from the out of tree solution [3] to
+the current solution.
+* The out of tree solution [3] will be deprecated.
+
+Developer impact
+----------------
+
+This blueprint will have no developer impact.
+
+Implementation
+==============
+
+Assignee(s)
+-----------
+
+Primary assignee:
+    Gil Meir
+
+Other contributors:
+  Irena Berezovsky
+
+Work Items
+----------
+
+* Add vif_type ib_hostdev support to LibvirtGenericVIFDriver
+
+Dependencies
+============
+
+proprietary 'ebrctl' library is required. This is installed as part
+of the Driver OFED package.
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+* Unit tests will be added to validate these modifications.
+* Adding Third party testing for nova with SR-IOV NIC (Ethernet and Infiniband)
+* Third party testing for neutron is already in place:
+  https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/ThirdPartySystems/Mellanox_CI
+
+
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+No documentation changes for Nova are anticipated.
+VIF_TYPE_IB_HOSTEV will be automatically enabled by Neutron where appropriate.
