Subject: [PATCH] Libvirt: Support for attaching volumes via SMB

Currently, there are Libvirt volume drivers that support
network-attached file systems such as Gluster of NFS. The purpose
of this blueprint is adding support for attaching volumes hosted
on a SMB share.

+Libvirt: Support for attaching volumes via SMB
+==============================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/libvirt-smbfs-volume-support
+
+Currently, there are Libvirt volume drivers that support network-attached
+file systems such as Gluster of NFS. The purpose of this blueprint is adding
+support for attaching volumes hosted on a SMB share.
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+SMB is another widely used protocol, especially in the Microsoft world. Its
+simplicity along with the big improvements that were introduced in SMB 3
+make this type of volume backend a very good alternative.
+
+SMB 3 brings features such as transparent failover, multichanneling using
+multiple NICs, encrypted communication, and RDMA. Newer versions of Samba
+are getting better support for the SMB 3 features, as well as supporting
+Active Directory membership.
+
+Use Cases
+----------
+
+Deployer will be able to attach block storage exported in the form of virtual
+disks on SMB shares to instances.
+
+Project Priority
+-----------------
+
+None
+
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+A new volume driver will be added in order to support attaching volumes
+hosted on SMB shares. The volume driver will have a similiar worflow with
+the NFS volume driver.
+
+The SMB volume driver will mount the SMB share on which a volume is hosted
+using credentials and other flags specified in the volume connection info.
+
+This feature will be backwards compatible, supporting older versions of SMB
+for simple tasks. It will support using any type of SMB share, including:
+
+- from Scale-Out file servers to basic Windows shares;
+
+- Linux SMB shares using Samba;
+
+- vendor specific hardware exporting SMB shares.
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+None
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+None
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+None
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+
+The share credentials will be parsed in the volume connection info and used
+when mounting a SMB share.
+
+Also, the driver will support Active Directory integration (as long as the
+Samba version supports it) so that it will be able to use AD credentials.
+
+Note that as SAMBA does not support SELinux labelling, in order to be able
+to boot from a volume hosted on a SMB share, the virt_use_samba SELinux
+option will have to be enabled. This has security implications, as there
+will no longer be any security isolation between VM disk images.
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+
+None
+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+
+None
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+None
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+The deployer will be able to configure the path where the SMB shares will be
+mounted, as well as setting mount flags.
+
+Also, the Libvirt-qemu uid and gid will have to be specified as mount flags
+in order to support attaching volumes because of Libvirt trying to change
+the owner of the volume.
+
+In order to support SMB3 and AD integration, Samba 4.0 or later is required.
+Note that any version of Samba is supported by this driver but as older
+versions don't support AD integration, you won't be able to use AD based
+authentication. Also, in this case you must make sure that the SMB server you
+are trying to access has no restrictions on the SMB protocol version, being
+able to fall back to an older version.
+
+Developer impact
+----------------
+
+None

+
+Work Items
+----------
+
+Add support for mounting SMB shares.
+
+Provide support for local shares.
+
+Dependencies
+============
+
+None
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+This feature should be tested using one of the SMB Cinder Volume drivers
+already available. The existing Tempest tests along with the according unit
+tests should be enough for the moment in order to test this.
+
+While a CI is being considered, for the moment Tempest tests will be run
+periodically for this scenario.
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+Using the SMB backend will be documented.
