+The End Goal of Nova API Policy
+===============================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/v3-api-policy
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/openstack/?searchtext=separated-policy-rule-v3-api
+
+There are some of ideas and requirements from Icehouse summit to improve
+the current nova API policy. This spec aims to provide a full view for the
+improvement of nova API policy to ensure the final goal is on the right way.
+
+There are two sub-specs for more detail:
+https://review.openstack.org/127160
+https://review.openstack.org/127863
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+There are several problems for current API policy.
+
+* The permission checking is spread through the various levels of the nova
+  code, also have some hard-code permission checking that make some polcy
+  rules didn't work.
+
+* API policy rules need better granularity. Some of extensions just use one
+  rule for all the APIs. Deployer can't get better granularity control for
+  the APIs.
+
+* More easy way to override default policy settings for deployer. And
+  Currently all the API(EC2, V2, V2.1) rules mix in one policy.conf file.
+
+Use Cases
+---------
+
+1. Operator want to specified role can access service API, but it's hard-code
+as only admin can operator those API.
+
+2. One policy rule for one API at REST API layer. Multiple rules in different
+layer really confuse the developer and deployer.
+
+3. Deployer can specified separated rule for each API in one extension.
+
+4. Deployer can override the default policy rule easily without mix his own
+config and default config in one policy.conf file.
+
+Project Priority
+----------------
+
+The kilo priorities list is currently not defined. However under the
+currently proposed list of priorities it would fall under "User
+Experience" as it significantly increases the ability for us to
+improve the Nova API.
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+The generic rule for all the improvement is keep V2 API back-compatible. The
+improvement just for EC2 and V2.1 API. Because V2 API may be depreciated after
+V2.1 parity with V2. And reduce the risk of broken what we have for now.
+
+* Enforcement policy at REST API layer and remove hard-code permission
+  checks.
+
+  Remove the permission checking from low layers of nova. This make
+  better usability for API policy. The detail describes at:
+  https://review.openstack.org/127160
+
+* Use different prefix in policy rule name for EC2/V2/V2.1 API.
+
+  After move all the policy into REST API layer, then all the API won't
+  share some policy enforcement in the compute API layer. So it's time
+  group them. We can provide different prefix in rule name for each API.
+
+  * EC2 API: We name the policy rule as "ec2_api:[action]"
+
+  * Nova V2 API: After we move to V2.1, we needn't spend time to change V2
+    api rule, and needn't to bother deployer upgrade their policy config. So
+    just keep V2 API poicy rule named as before.
+
+  * Nova V2.1 API: We name the policy rule as
+    "os_compute_api:[extension]:[action]". The core API may be changed in
+    the future, so we needn't name them as "compute" or "compute_extension"
+    to distinguish the core or extension API.
+
+* Port policy.d from oslo-incubator into nova.
+
+  The policy.d already implement at oslo-incubator:
+      https://review.openstack.org/#/c/105362/
+
+  This feature make deployer can override default policy rule easily. And
+  When nova default policy config changed, deployer only need replace default
+  policy config files with new one. It won't affect his own policy config in
+  other files.
+
+* Group the policy rules into different policy files.
+
+  After support policy.d we can separated the policy rules as separated
+  files, then deployer will more clear for which rule he can set for specified
+  API. The rules can be grouped as below:
+
+  * policy.conf: It only contains the generic rule, like:
+
+::
+    "context_is_admin":  "role:admin",
+    "admin_or_owner":  "is_admin:True or project_id:%(project_id)s",
+    "default": "rule:admin_or_owner",
+
+  * policy.d/00-ec2-api.conf: It contains all the policy rules for EC2 API.
+
+  * policy.d/00-v2-api.conf: It contains all the policy rules for nova V2 API.
+
+  * policy.d/00-v2.1-api.conf: It contains all the policy rules for nova v2.1
+    API.
+
+* Add separated rule for each API in extension.
+
+  This is for provider better granularity for policy rules. The detail at:
+  https://review.openstack.org/127863
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+The alternative is the status quo which is confusing for both deployers as
+well as developers having to maintain the current implementation
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+None
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+None
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+
+All of those improvement aims to provide more clear and easier way to config
+API policy, that reduce the mistake happened when change policy config.
+
+There are more detail for separated propose at:
+https://review.openstack.org/127160
+https://review.openstack.org/127863
+
+These improvements will require very rigorous double checking and high
+quality reviews to ensure that security bugs are not introduced as the
+nova internal calls can be called from quite a few different code
+paths (Ec2, V2 API, V2.1 API and other internals).
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+None
+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+None
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+There are more detail for separated propose at:
+https://review.openstack.org/127160
+https://review.openstack.org/127863
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+* Enforcement policy at REST API layer and remove hard-code permission
+  checks.
+
+  There is affect after remove hard-code permission checks. The deployer
+  need update their policy config file, to add permission checks for API
+  that db layer hard-code was removed.
+
+* Use different prefix in policy rule name for EC2/V2/V2.1 API.
+
+  There isn't any affect for V2 API. For EC2 API, it need deployer update
+  their policy config. For V2.1 API, there isn't any user yet, so there
+  won't any effect.
+
+* Port policy.d from oslo-incubator into nova.
+
+  There isn't any affect for this.
+
+* Group the policy rules into different policy files.
+
+  Deployer can put his old policy config file into policy directory also.
+  Then their old config can override the default config.
+
+* Add separated rule for each API in extension.
+
+  This need user to move the policy rule into separated rule for each API.
+
+
+Developer impact
+----------------
+
+After those improvement, nova will have more clear way to add permission
+checks.
