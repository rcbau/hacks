Subject: [PATCH] Add a new libvirt volume driver for Huawei SDSHypervisor

Add a new volume driver in nova/virt/libvirt/volume.py file to realize
attach/detach volume to qemu-kvm instance, and realize abstract volume dirver
methods:
* connect_volume
* disconnect_volume

+New libvirt volume driver for Huawei SDSHypervisor
+==================================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/huawei-sdshypervisor-volume-driver
+
+The purpose of this spec is to add a new libvirt volume driver for
+Huawei SDSHypervisor.
+
+Huawei SDSHypervisor is a storage virtualization solution, is a software
+running in host, just focus on the data plane, the goal is to facilitate
+the reuse of customer's existing old and low-end devices. SDSHypervisor does
+not interact with the storage device in control plane, such as create volume,
+create snapshot, do not need third-party device manufacturers to develop any
+driver. Administrator just attaches Lun to the hypervisor node as hypervisor
+storage entity and hypervisor will provide virtual volume based user's QoS
+and patch advance feature to these Lun such as snapshot, link clone, cache,
+thin provision and so on.
+
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+Currently, Huawei SDShypervisor cinder driver bp and code is approved
+by cinder, users now are able to access Huawei SDShypervisor by
+Openstack Cinder.
+
+Because Huawei SDSHypervisor uses a private key-value data protocol,
+we have to register a new lower level driver which can capture SCSI data
+from SCSI middle layer and copy these data from core mode to SDSHypervisor
+process in user mode for high performance. In order to achieve these we have
+to use a private method to implement connect_volume and disconnect_volume and
+add new libvirt volume driver to realize attach/detach volume.
+
+Use Cases
+----------
+
+* End User attach volume from SDSHypervisor to nova instance and use it.
+
+Project Priority

+None
+
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+Add a new libvirt volume driver to realize attach/detach volume.
+The driver uses sds_cli cmd to implement attach/detach/querydev vol,
+sds_cli will be put to a specific dir and the path is registered as a system
+environment variable when sds is installed.
+
+The following diagram shows the command and data paths.
