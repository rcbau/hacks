+=============================================
+Add support for live block device I/O tune
+=============================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/support-live-io-tune-on-blk
+
+Libvirt supports live change block device io-tune, we can enable this in nova,
+to provide flexible control of io usage of an instance.
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+Currently, nova supports setting qemu io-tune from flavor extra_specs,
+but we can not change these parameters when the instance is active.
+
+read_bytes_sec
+read_iops_sec
+total_bytes_sec
+total_iops_sec
+write_bytes_sec
+write_iops_sec
+
+Libvirt supports live changing io throttling, and libvirt driver already have
+api, by enable this in nova, we can set above parameters of block device
+on an active instance.
+
+Use Cases
+----------
+
+Alice has five virtual machines deployed already in her cloud.
+In order to control costs related to block device I/O,
+Alice wishes to throttle I/O write and read rates on a couple of her
+instances. She wants to be able to make a REST API call that tells
+the underlying hypervisor to adjust I/O QoS on a specified instance.
+
+Project Priority
+-----------------
+
+None
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+Currently, user can set io-tune information in flavor before instance bootup,
+these values can not be changed when the instance is active.
+
+This specification propose a change to let user can change the io-tune
+information when the instance is active.
+
+User can update server_metadata to change block io-tune information, these
+server_metadata changes will be reflect to libvirt driver, libvirt driver
+will change the block device io-tune info per server_metadata changes.
+
+Check if io-tune information in server_metadata exist before rebuild/
+resize/restart an instance (if io-tune information has already in
+flavor extra_specs, overwrite them).
+
+Implement change_instance_metadata function of libvirt driver to support
+change io-tune information when doing instance metadata update.
+
+And the io-tune setting can't exceed the limited set by flavor extra_spec.
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+Another way is add new rest api to update the io-tune setting. With that way,
+it still need some way to persist the io-tune setting.
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+There are some metadata will effort on the io-tune in the server metadata:
+
+quota:read_bytes_sec
+quota:read_iops_sec
+quota:total_bytes_sec
+quota:total_iops_sec
+quota:write_bytes_sec
+quota:write_iops_sec
+
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+None
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+
+None
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+
+None
+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+
+user can get/set block device io-tune information by update server metadata.
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+Every time geting guest config from libvirt driver will do the check of
+quota information in instance.metadata and overwrite flavor's extra specs.
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+None
+
+Developer impact
+----------------
+
+None
