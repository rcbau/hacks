Subject: [PATCH] Quiesce filesystems with QEMU guest agent during image
 snapshot

Currently we need to quiesce filesystems (fsfreeze) manually before
snapshotting an image of active instances to create consistent backups.
This proposal is to automate the fsfreeze using QEMU Guest Agent.

+=====================================================================
+Quiescing filesystems with QEMU guest agent during image snapshotting
+=====================================================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/quiesced-image-snapshots-with-qemu-guest-agent
+
+When QEMU Guest Agent is installed in a kvm instance, we can request the
+instance to freeze filesystems via libvirt during snapshotting to make the
+snapshot consistent.
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+Currently we need to quiesce filesystems (fsfreeze) manually before
+snapshotting an image of active instances to create consistent backups.
+This should be automated when QEMU Guest Agent is enabled.
+
+(Quiescing for cinder volume snapshot is covered by another proposal [1]_)
+
+Use Cases
+---------
+
+With this feature, users can create a snapshot image with consistent
+file systems state while the instances are running (fsck will not run when
+the snapshot image is booted).
+
+It will be nice when:
+
+* taking a quick backup before installing or upgrading softwares.
+* automatically taking backup images every night.
+
+Project Priority
+----------------
+
+None
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+When QEMU Guest Agent is enabled in an instance, Nova-compute libvirt driver
+will request the agent to freeze the filesystems (and applications if
+fsfreeze-hook is installed) before taking snapshot of the image.
+After taking snapshot, the driver will request the agent to thaw the
+filesystems.
+
+The prerequisites of this feature are:
+
+1. the hypervisor is 'qemu' or 'kvm'
+
+2. libvirt >= 1.2.5 (which has fsFreeze/fsThaw API) is installed in the
+   hypervisor
+
+3. 'hw_qemu_guest_agent=yes' property and 'hw_require_fsfreeze=yes' property
+   is set on the image metadata,
+   and QEMU Guest Agent is installed and enabled in the instance
+
+When quiesce is failed even though these conditions are satisfied
+(e.g. the agent is not responding), snapshotting may fail by exception
+not to get inconsistent snapshots.
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+Rewrite nova's snapshotting with libvirt's domain.reateSnapshot API with
+VIR_DOMAIN_SNAPSHOT_CREATE_QUIESCE flag, although it will change the current
+naming scheme of disk images. In addition, it cannot be leveraged to implement
+live snapshot of cinder volumes.

+
+Work Items
+----------
+
+1. Implement the automatic quiesce during snapshotting when it is available.
+2. Enable the test to run in CI with libvirt >= 1.2.5
+
+
+Dependencies
+============
+
+None
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+Live snapshotting with an image with qemu-guest-agent should be added to
+scenario tests.
+Note that it requires environment with libvirt >= 1.2.5.
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+Need to document how to use this feature in the operation guide (which
+currently recommends you use the fsfreze tool manually).
