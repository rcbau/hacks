+Restrict Image Types
+====================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/restrict-image-types
+
+Currently, if a deployment has flavors that are designed for a specific
+hypervisor or should be used only with specific images, invalid permutations
+can be created. The introduction of filters to limit flavors to groups of
+servers (i.e. a cell or host aggregate) and images to flavors would prevent
+such invalid permutations.
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+As a deployer I would like to limit a group of servers to diskless flavors so
+that the resources configured with diskless flavors in mind are not consumed by
+non-diskless flavor instances.
+
+As a deployer I would like to limit diskless flavors to a specific group of
+images, such as small iPXE boot ISOs, so that the limited space on the
+hypervisor is not consumed.
+
+As a deployer I would like to limit a group of servers to flavors that will be
+supported by the hypervisor type within that group of servers so that flavors
+that aren't fully supported by the hypervisor are not loaded on the hypervisor.
+
+As a deployer I would like to limit flavors designed for a specific hypervisor
+type to images that are supported by that flavor.
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+* Introduce the concept of flavor groups. A minimal viable solution would be to
+  support flavor groups as an extra spec.
+
+* Add the capability to limit groups of servers to certain flavor groups.
+
+* Add the capability to reject build requests for incompatible image / flavor
+  group combinations.
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+* Flavor groups could be a new type that contains a list of flavors.
+
+* Flavor groups could be labels on a flavor.
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+* Flavor groups as an extra spec would have no impact on the data model.
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+None
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+
+None
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+
+None
+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+
+User images will be restricted based on flavor group.
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+None
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+Flavor group metadata on the images will be used by flavor group ACLs to limit
+images to certain flavors.
+
+New config options:
+
+* image_flavor_groups_enable_acls (default: False): Enable ACLs to filter which
+  images are allowed for a given flavor group.
+
+* image_flavor_groups_acl_property (default: flavor_groups): The property on
+  images for flavor group ACLs.
+
+* image_flavor_groups_acl_extra_specs_key (default: flavor_group): The flavor
+  group extra specs key used to obtain the flavor group for a
+  flavor.
+
+* image_flavor_groups_default_acl (default: deny all): Default flavor groups
+  ACL when the property doesn't exist on an image.
+
+Server groups will require supported flavor groups within their configuration.
+
+Developer impact

+
+None
