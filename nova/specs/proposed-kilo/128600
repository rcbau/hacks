+===================================
+VMware: Support for vSAN Datastores
+===================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/vmware-vsan-support
+
+Currently the vmwareapi compute driver only supports deploying instances to NFS
+and VMFS datastores. This blueprint proposes to add support for using vSAN
+storage as well.
+
+Explanation of terminology used:
+
+The term "datastore" as referred to in the spec and the driver refers to
+the vSphere concept a logical storage container, a place where VM data (among
+other things) is kept. The purpose of this abstraction is to provide a uniform
+way for vSphere clients to access said VM data regardless of what hardware, I/O
+protocols or transport protocols are used by the underlying storage.
+
+All vSphere datastores until recently has been broadly divided into two types,
+VMFS and NFS. The vmwareapi driver has been supporting the use of both since
+its inception, without having to distinguish between either, largely because of
+this datastore abstraction.
+
+vSAN storage is a third type of datastore introduced in vSphere. It is
+a software-defined distributed storage that aggregates disks (magnetic for
+capacity, SSD for cache/performance) attached to a group of hosts into a
+single storage pool. That pool is once again exposed as a single datastore.
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+Currently datastores with type "vsan" is ignored by compute driver entirely.
+One obstacle to using this type of datastore is that virtual disk data files
+(the "-flat.vmdk" files) are not directly addressable as datastore paths. Since
+both the spawn and snapshot workflow in the vmware driver addresses the data
+files in some way, they will have to be changed to support vSAN datastores.
+
+Use Cases
+----------
+
+The End User will be able to use vSAN datastores and deploy streamOptimized
+images.
+
+Project Priority
+-----------------
+
+None
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+The change is divided into two areas:
+
+* Recognize and use datastores of a new type ("vsan").
+* Update existing code involved in exporting and importing Glance images to
+  use alternate vSphere APIs that does not address disk data files directly.
+
+The second area of change is mainly provided by the image-transfer
+functionality in the oslo.vmware library [*]_. The proposal is to update the
+code to use said library.
+
+However, the only disk format that these alternate APIs support is the
+'streamOptimized' format. (The streamOptimized format is a sparse, compressed,
+and stream-friendly version of the VMDK disk that is well suited for
+import/export use cases, such as the glance<->hypervisor exchanges described
+above). This implies that only streamOptimized disk images are deployable on
+vSAN. The driver will be modified to recognize Glance vmdk images tagged
+with the property vmware_disktype='streamOptimized' as disks of such format,
+and only use the alternate APIs when handling disks of this format.
+
+.. [*] To import a disk image to a vSAN datastore, oslo.vmware uses the
+   ImportVApp vSphere API is used to import the image as a shadow virtual
+   machine (a VM container to hold a reference to the base disk disk, and is
+   not meant to be powered on). Likewise, to export the disk image, the library
+   uses the ExportVM vSphere API.  These APIs do not reference the virtual disk
+   data file paths directly and are hence compatible with vSAN storage.
+
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+None.
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+None
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+None
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+
+None
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+
+None
+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+
+None
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+None
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+There is a new configuration option under the [vmware] section,
+"image_transfer_timeout_secs", which configures how long an image transfer can
+proceed before timing out.
+
+In order to deploy existing VMDK images to vSAN, these images will have to be
+converted to streamOptimized and reimported to glance.
+
+
+Developer impact
+----------------
+
+Minimal. The changes related to blueprint are mostly isolated in the areas of
+handling a new vmdk format type and add recognition and use of an additional
+datastore type called "vsan".

+
+Work Items
+----------
+
+The work is broadly decomposed into:
+
+* use oslo.vmware image_transfer module to handle download of images
+* use oslo.vmware image_transfer module to handle upload of image snapshot
+* update driver to allow the use of datastores of type vSAN.
+* update driver to recognized a new vmdk format (streamOptimized)
+
+
+Dependencies
+============
+
+None
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+Since Tempest in general does not support driver-specific tests, the proposal
+is to update the MineSweeper CI
+(https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/NovaVMware/Minesweeper), to provide
+vCenter with vSAN storage and additional tests to verify existing Tempest
+tests passes when invoked against compute nodes using it.
+
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+New information in the vmware driver section of the Nova documentation will
+have to be added to document:
+
+* How to configure a compute node for vSAN use.
+* The virtual disk format requirement ("streamOptimized" only) when using vSAN
+  storage.
+* The new "image_transfer_timeout_secs" configuration option.
+* How to obtain a streamOptimized disk from a virtual machine or vmdk disk in a
+  non-streamOptimized format.
