+support sriov interface attach/detach
+==========================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/sriov-interface-attach-detach
+
+SR-IOV makes it possible for a VM to directly send packets to the VIC (virtual
+interface card) without having the hypervisor involved.
+Normal network adapter hotplug [NETWORK_ADAPTER_HOTPLUG]_ is supported in Feb,
+2014. And in Juno release, the libvirt driver is enhanced to support SR-IOV
+networking by [LIBVIRT_SUPPORT_SR-IOV]_. Also [PCI_PASSTHROUGH_SRIOV]_ enables
+a nova instance to be booted up with neutron SRIOV ports.
+Now we can support attach or detach SR-IOV interfaces to an active VM if host
+supports SR-IOV base on the above patches.
+
+There are two variants in connecting a SR-IOV port to its corresponding VF.
+A SR-IOV port may be directly connected to its VF [DIRECT_SR-IOV]_. Or it may
+be connected with a macvtap device that resides on the host, which is then
+connected to the corresponding VF [MACVTAP_SR-IOV]_. Both connecting types will
+be supported.
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+Right now it is possible to attach/detach a normal interface for an active VM
+by nova attach_interface/detach_interface API.
+However, it's not possible to request access to virtual network dynamically via
+SR-IOV NICs at present.
+
+
+For example we can create a direct SR-IOV port by:
+  neutron port-create <net-id> --binding:vnic-type direct
+
+Then we can do the following to attach interface to a VM:
+
+  nova interface-attach [--port-id <port_id>] [--fixed-ip <fixed_ip>] <server>
+
+Nova attach interface api hotplug an interface to an existing server.
+The normal pci allocation has already finished after the server boot up.
+If the port to be hotplugged for this server is "direct' or 'macvtap', it just
+not works because no pci device allocated for it yet.
+
+The Nova interface-attach API needs be enhanced to support SR-IOV.
+We need to translate the port to pci request in the 'nova attach-interface' API
+stage, and allocate the pci devices on host to support the hotplug a SRIOV
+port.
+
+
+Use Cases
+----------
+
+Alice wants certain virtual machines to have access to faster networking
+interfaces. She configures her virtual machine instance as normal.
+After launch, Alice wishes to add a new network interface to her virtual
+machine that has better performance than the network interface already on her
+VM. She calls an API to attach a new network interface, passing in some tag
+that indicates a better tier of performance for the interface.

+Project Priority

+None
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+attach_interface
+----------------
+For attach interface there is only 2 things that need to be addressed.
+
+First one is converting the port/network information from attach interface API
+to a pci request. The API to create a PCI request already exists.
+
+The second thing is alloc the pci device on the host (nova/compute/manager).
+Libvirt has already supported generating the pci xml for server, and it can
+attach allocated SR-IOV port correctly.
+
+detach_interface
+----------------
+We need to refresh PCI status to free the device object after detach a SR-IOV
+port.

+
+Additional pci request will be called, that will bring slightly performance

+
+Testing
+=======
+
+Both unit and tempest tests need to be created to ensure proper functioning of
+SR-IOV networking. For tempest testing, given the nature of SR-IOV depending on
+hardware, it may require vendor support and use of proper neutron ML2 mechanism
+drivers. Cisco Neutron CI and Mellanox External Testing need to be enhanced in
+support of SR-IOV tempest testing.
+
+Also intel has been working on getting a PCI CI up and voting on Nova
+[INTEL_PCI_CI]_. External testing will be enhanced after this CI is finished.
+
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+* a user guide/wiki on how to use SR-IOV networking in openstack
