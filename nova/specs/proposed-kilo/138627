Subject: [PATCH] Support the detection and alarm of orphans

In existing OpenStack cluster, there are some orphans on many compute node,
these orphans consumes a lot of resources, but the OpenStack can not manage
these orphans, and also can't timely detection and notify the user to clean up,
so I think that the nova should be able to manage these orphans, and can notify
the admin or user to process it.

+Support the detection and alarm of orphans
+==========================================

+
+The orphans is a VM is on the hypervisor, but it didn't been managed by
+OpenStack.
+
+In existing OpenStack cluster, there are some orphans on many compute node,
+these orphans consumes a lot of resources, but the OpenStack can not manage
+these orphans, and also can't timely detection and notify the user to clean up,
+so I think that the nova should be able to manage these orphans, and can notify
+the admin or user to process it.
+
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+At present, in the use of a period of time in the cluster found many orphans,
+it waste a lot of resources, but the OpenStack can not manage these orphans,
+the user or admin_user can't find them in time, and also don't know which host
+they are on. So, I think that the openstack can manage these orphans, and
+notify the admin_user to process it.
+
+Use Cases
+----------
+
+Orphans-alarm can run in the computer node, it can regularly check orphans, and
+discovered promptly to notify the monitoring module.
+
+
+Project Priority
+-----------------
+
+None
+
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+* In the nova-compute, we can add a timer task to check orphans, and in the
+  ceilometer, we should add a monitoring items to record the information.
+
+* The nova found the orphans and send the message to the ceilometer, then the
+  ceilometer collected the message and push the message to the user or admin.
+
+* The nova-compute reported the orphans information into database, nova-api
+  can support the user to query the orphans and whether the openstack manager
+  the orphans.
+
+* If the user decide the openstack to manager the orphans, the nova created the
+  the record into instance table, from this time, the orphans same as the
+  instance.
