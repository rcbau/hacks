Subject: [PATCH] Support the detection and alarm of orphans

In existing OpenStack cluster, there are some orphans on many compute
node, these orphans consumes a lot of resources, but the OpenStack can not
manage these orphans, and also can't timely detection and notify the user to
clean up, so I think that the nova should be able to manage these orphans, and
can notify the admin or user to process it.

+Problem description
+===================
+
+At present, in the use of a period of time in the cluster found many orphans, it
+waste a lot of resources, but the OpenStack can not manage these orphans, the
+user or admin_user can't find them in time, and also don't know which host they
+are on. So, I think that the openstack can manage these orphans, and notify the
+admin_user to process it.
+
+Use Cases
+----------
+
+Orphans-alarm can run in the computer node, it can Regularly check orphans, and
+discovered promptly to notify the monitoring module.

+
+None
+
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+In the nova-compute, we can add a timer task to check orphans, and in the
+ceilometer, we should add a monitoring items to record the information.
+
+The nova found the orphans and send the message to the ceilometer, then the
+ceilometer collected the message and push the message to the user or admin.
