Subject: [PATCH] Add spec for 'Enhance iSCSI volume multipath support'

This spec proposes to enhance iSCSI multipath support by defining the way for
get multiple iSCSI portals/iqns/luns to access a volume (LU) from Cinder.

+Enhance iSCSI volume multipath support
+==========================================
+
+Include the URL of your launchpad blueprint:
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/iscsi-multipath-enhancement
+
+This spec proposes to enhance multipath support of cinder iSCSI volumes.
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+Currently, nova-compute supports multipath for iSCSI volume data path.
+It depends on response to targets discovery of from the main iSCSI portal,
+expecting multiple portal addresses are contained.
+
+However, some arrays only respond to discovery with a single portal address,
+even if secondary portals are available. In this case, nova-compute cannot know
+secondary portals and corresponding iSCSI target IQN, so nova-compute cannot
+establish multiple sessions for the target(s). To enable nova-compute to
+login to secondary portals, cinder should tell the secondary portal
+addresses and corresponding target iqns/luns.
+
+Telling secondary portal addresses and iqns/luns is also useful for arrays
+which can respond to discovery with multiple portals addresses and IQNs, since
+compute can access to the volume via secondary portals even when the main
+portal is unaccessible due to network trouble.
+(Note that compute should attach the volume via multipath device "dm-X" so
+that the session to the main portal can be re-established when the network
+is recovered.)
+
+Use Cases
+---------
+
+This proposal is useful to improve availability of volume operations by
+enabling multipath feature with iSCSI storage arrays currently not supported.
+
+Project Priority
+----------------
+
+None
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+When 'iscsi_use_multipath' is enabled in nova.conf, nova should pass new
+optional parameter 'multipath=True' to Cinder's initialize_connection API.
+If this is specified, some backend drivers of Cinder will return multiple
+iSCSI portal addresses and corresponding IQNs/LUNs to login to the iSCSI
+target.
+
+When nova-compute receive multiple addresses/IQNs/LUNs, it should login to
+every targret specified by these parameters.
+Even if a part of the portals are not responding, the connection process
+should be continued when the other are responding.
+
+If multiple addresses are not returned from APIs, it should find multiple
+targets using discovery, as in the existing design, for compatibility.
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+None
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+None.
+
+Note that 'connection_info' JSON string with new parameters are stored in the
+table 'block_device_mapping', but it doesn't require changes of schema.
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+None
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+
+None
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+
+None
+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+
+None
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+None
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+To enable this feature, 'iscsi_use_multipath' should be set to True in
+the [libvirt] section of nova.conf.
+
+Developer impact
+----------------
+
+None

+Work Items
+----------
+
+- Implement this feature in Cinder
+- Modify nova and brick library to login to multiple portals
+
+Dependencies
+============
+
+None
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+- Unit tests for connect_volume/disconnect_volume for iSCSI volumes should be
+  added to check if they can handle response from initialize_connection volume
+  API with and without new parameters.
