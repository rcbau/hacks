+================================================================
+Support KVM/libvirt on System z (S/390) as a hypervisor platform
+================================================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/libvirt-kvm-systemz
+
+Add support for KVM/libvirt in Linux on System z as a Nova hypervisor
+platform.  The existing Nova driver for KVM/libvirt will be used. There are
+some platform-specific changes needed in the Nova driver to get the platform
+going.
+
+Additional OpenStack functionality beyond initial Nova support is not part of
+this blueprint; we will have specific additional blueprints for that, as
+needed.
+
+A 3rd party Continuous Integration environment for OpenStack for KVM/libvirt
+on System z will be established and maintained.
+
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+The existing Nova driver for KVM/libvirt does not work unchanged for KVM on
+System z.
+
+The issues currently known, are:
+
+1. The System z machine type (``'s390-ccw-virtio'``) needs to be returned by
+   ``LibvirtDriver._get_machine_type()``, if the host architecture is System z.
+   This then causes the ``os/type/@machine`` attribute in the libvirt
+   domain.xml to be set up accordingly.
+
+2. The CPU capabilities returned by libvirt on System z do not include the
+   ``model`` element. This is intended to be added to libvirt, but until then
+   we need a temporary circumvention in the Nova driver (adding the model
+   information from /proc/cpuinfo if not present and if on S390x).
+
+3. For the interactive console and the log of OpenStack instances, console
+   devices need to be generated (instead of serial devices), if the host
+   architecture is System z (see `[2]`_).  These console devices need to have a
+   target type ``"sclp"`` for the interactive console of OpenStack, and
+   ``"sclplm"`` for the log of OpenStack.
+
+   Background: Linux on System z writes its messages during its early boot
+   phases to an interface called "SCLP".  SCLP is available in QEMU as a
+   console device.  As a result, it is also a console device in libvirt, with
+   type="pty" and target type="sclp" for the interactive console of OpenStack,
+   and with type="file" and target type="sclplm" ("lm" for "line mode") for the
+   log of OpenStack.  If we use the default target type ("virtio"), we will not
+   capture the messages written by Linux in its early boot phases, and we do
+   want to provide them.
+
+   Changing the default target type for console devices in libvirt to "sclp" or
+   "sclplm" (e.g. dependent on the ``console/@type`` attribute) would be a
+   backwards incompatible change of libvirt.
+
+   If commonality in the Nova driver across the libvirt platforms is important:
+   A console device could also be used for other platforms including x86, and
+   is already used in one of the code paths in the current Nova driver.  Serial
+   devices in libvirt are meant to represent serial ports (aka RS-232), so they
+   are not an ideal choice anyway, for interactive console and log.
+
+4. The FCP support in the libvirt volume driver needs to be adjusted to
+   the System z specific format of the device file paths.
+
+In the hypervisor support matrix
+(https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/HypervisorSupportMatrix),
+the (new) column for KVM/libvirt on System z is intended to look like the
+column for KVM/libvirt on x86, except that the following functions will not be
+supported (in addition to those marked as not supported for KVM/libvirt on
+x86):
+
+* VNC Console
+* SPICE Console
+* Inject Networking
+
+For block storage, Cinder will be supported.
+
+For networking, Neutron will be supported. Nova networking should work but will
+not be a focus.
+
+As a result, all features marked as required on
+https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/HypervisorSupportMatrix/Requirements
+will be supported for KVM/libvirt on System z.
+
+Use Cases

+Use OpenStack with KVM on System z

+None
+
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+Change code in the libvirt Nova driver to address these issues, dependent on
+the host capabilities indicating a CPU architecture of ``arch.S390X``.
+For details, see section `Work Items`_.

+
+Work Items
+----------
+
+In ``nova/virt/libvirt/driver.py``:
+
+* For issue 1:
+  In ``LibvirtDriver._get_machine_type()``, return the System z machine type
+  (``'s390-ccw-virtio'``), if the host architecture is System z.
+* For issue 2:
+  In `` LibvirtDriver._get_host_capabilities()``,  add the ``model`` variable
+  to the capabilities, if not present and if the host architecture is System z;
+  the model is based on the machine type from /proc/cpuinfo.
+* For issue 3:
+  In ``LibvirtDriver._get_guest_config()``, create console devices instead of
+  serial devices for the interactive console and for the log, with target type
+  "sclplm" (for the log) and "sclp" (for the interactive console), if the host
+  architecture is System z.
+
+In ``nova/virt/libvirt/config.py``:
+
+* For issue 3:
+  In ``LibvirtConfigGuestChar.__init__()`` and ``format_dom()``, add support
+  for specifying a target type.
+
+In ``nova/virt/libvirt/volume.py``:
+
+* For issue 4:
+  The FCP support in the libvirt volume driver needs to be adjusted to
+  the System z specific format of the device file paths.
+
+In ``nova/virt/libvirt/utils.py``:
+
+* For issue 4:
+  Possibly, supporting utility functions for the FCP support issue are needed.
+
+Doc changes (see section `Documentation Impact`_).
+
+
+Dependencies
+============
+
+* Software versions:
+
+  - Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher
+  - libvirt: 1.0.4 or higher
+  - qemu: 1.4.0 or higher
+
+* 3rd party CI environment for KVM/libvirt on System z set up
+
+* Future replacements for temporary circumventions:
+
+  - libvirt patch to add model information to CPU capabilities.
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+Unit test:
+
+* Existing Nova unit tests should suffice for the generic bits of Nova.
+* Additional Nova unit tests for any s390-specific behaviors will be written.
+
+3rd party CI:
+
+* A 3rd party CI environment for KVM/libvirt on Systemz will be set up and run
+  by by IBM, to run full tempest tests.
+
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+* No changes needed in config docs.
+
+* Doc changes for the platform will be made as needed (details are to be
+  determined).
