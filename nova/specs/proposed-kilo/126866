Subject: [PATCH] vmware: Enable VCDriver with NFS glance source datastore

It enables the VmwareVCDriver to improve the image
copying process from glance to vmware_temp by
exposing glace image file store as NFS share and
mount it on the vCenter cluster as NFS datastore

+Enable VmwareVCDriver with NFS glance image datastore
+======================================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/vmware-vc-driver-nfs-datastore-image-copy
+
+This blueprint enables VmwareVCDrvier to copy the image from the glance by
+using NFS image store configured in the glance.
+
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+When instance is booted from an image, the VmwareVCDriver copies the image
+from glance into 'vmware_temp' caching by means of glance REST API. It makes
+image copying process to be slower and consumes the nova-compute CPU and
+memory resource. This can be improved by using NFS image store on the glance as
+mentioned in below section.
+
+Use Cases
+---------
+
+* Performance improvement: Cloud providers wants to improve the boot process
+  by configuring NFS appropriately
+
+
+Project Priority
+----------------
+None
+
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+Assume that admin has made following setup:
+
+* Once Glance is installed with file system as image store, install and
+  configure NFS on the glance image store
+* On the vCenter cluster, which is consumed as compute node, create the NFS
+  datastore from the glance image store configured in above step and let the
+  name be 'glance_image_store'.
+
+Then following are the changes in the nova:
+
+* In nova.conf, under [vmware] section, add a new config parameter named,
+  'nfs_glance_datastore' and set the value as 'glance_image_store'
+* update the driver code to copy the image from the NFS glance datastore
+  instead of using glance API.
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+The existing logic is alternative to this blueprint

+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+If both the glance store and the destination temporary directory are on NFS,
+then the copy can happen in vCenter itself, instead of going through
+nova-compute and its very faster approach compared to existing one.
+
+With MS Windows vCenter, followings are the improvement shown up during the
+testing phase:
+
+* For 800 MB disk size, nova instance boot time has reduced from 16 minutes to
+  6 minutes
+* For 1 GB disk szie, nova instance boot time has reduced from 18 minutes to
+  7.2 minutes
+* For 1.5 GB disk szie, nova instance boot time has reduced from 21 minutes to
+  8.1 minutes
+
+Other deployer impact

+
+Work Items
+----------
+
+* Add new variable 'nfs_glance_datastore' to to nova.conf and set default to
+  None.
+* Add a new utility method in vim_utils to copy the image file from
+  'nfs_glance_datastore' to 'vmware_temp'
+* update the image copying logic to use the above defined new method
+  if 'nfs_glance_datastore' is configured, otherwise use existing logic
+
+
+Dependencies
+============
+
+There is no dependency.
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+* provide required unit tests to test the image copy with and without
+  nfs_glance_datastore in place
+* add required tempest test cases.
+* Vmware minesweeper to be updated with required NFS setup in place in
+  both glance and vCenter. The same should be tested without using NFS.
+
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+As mentioned the "proposed change" section, the nova.conf will be updated.
