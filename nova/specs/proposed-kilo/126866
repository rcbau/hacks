boot process by using NFS with glance file system
based image store and all hypervisors.

+Nova boot optimization using NFS image store
+============================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/vmware-vc-driver-nfs-datastore-image-copy
+
+This blueprint enables all hypervisor nova drivers to copy the glance image
+directly through NFS by using glance file system image store enabled with NFS.
+
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+When instance is booted from an image, the all hypervisor drivers (including
+VmwareVCDriver) copies the image from glance into respective hypervisor
+image cache by means of glance REST API. It makes image copying process
+to be slower and consumes more CPU, RAM and network resources in both
+glance-api and nova-compute. This can be improved by using NFS image
+store on the glance as detailed below.
+
+Use Cases
+---------
+
+* Performance improvement: Cloud providers wants to improve the nova instance
+  boot process by using NFS
+
+
+Project Priority
+----------------
+None
+
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+(For VMWare VC driver, details are provided here and for other hypervisor
+drivers same approach is applicable)
+
+Pre-requisites:
+
+* Once Glance is installed with file system as image store, install and
+  configure NFS on the glance image store
+* For example, create the datastore in ESX Cluster from the NFS glance
+  image store and name as 'glance_image_store'.
+
+Update the driver with below functionality:
+
+* update the driver code to copy the image from the NFS glance datastore
+  instead of using glance python-client, which will trigger the hypervisor
+  to copy the image directly from NFS into hypervisor image-cache.
+* get(include_locations=True) method in nova/image/api.py will provide the
+  image location on the NFS image store, and use it for identifying the
+  image in the 'glance_image_store'.
+
+NOTE: The same can be done for all other hypervisors.

+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+In case of VMWare VC driver, a POC of this blueprint reported below metrics:
+
+With MS Windows vCenter, followings are the improvement shown up during the
+testing phase:
+
+* For 800 MB disk size, nova instance boot time has reduced from 16 minutes to
+  6 minutes
+* For 1 GB disk szie, nova instance boot time has reduced from 18 minutes to
+  7.2 minutes
+* For 1.5 GB disk szie, nova instance boot time has reduced from 21 minutes to
+  8.1 minutes

+Other deployer impact

+
+Work Items
+----------
+
+* Add required config change in nova.conf to refer 'glance_image_store'
+* update all the hypervisor driver to incorporate required changes
+
+
+Dependencies
+============
+
+There is no dependency.
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+* provide required unit tests to test the image copy with and without
+  nfs_glance_datastore in place
+
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+Add required guidelines for admin to configure NFS for glance image store
+and how to configure nova.conf
