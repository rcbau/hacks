Subject: [PATCH] OpenStack should support the alarm of orphans

In existing OpenStack cluster, there are some orphans on many compute
node, these orphans consumes a lot of resources, but the OpenStack can not
manage these orphans, and also can't timely detection and notify the user
to clean up, so I think that the nova should be able to manage these
orphans, and can notify the admin or user to process it.

Implements blueprint support-orphans-manage
