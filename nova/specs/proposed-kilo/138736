+============================================
+Add VIF_VHOSTUSER vif type to libvirt driver
+============================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/libvirt-vif-vhost-user
+
+We propose to add a new VIF type to support the new QEMU vhost-user
+interface in libvirt dirver. vhost-user is a new QEMU feature that supports
+efficient Virtio-net I/O between a guest and a user-space vswitch.
+vhost-user is the userspace equivalent to /dev/vhost-net and is based on
+a Unix socket for communication instead of a kernel device file.
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+QEMU has a new type of network interface, vhost-user, and we want to
+make this available to Neutron drivers. This will support deploying
+high-throughput userspace vswitches for OpenStack-based applications.
+There are two types of vSwitches that can use vhost-user
+interface, a generic vhost-user vSwitch and ovs based one, both types
+should be supported.
+
+Use Cases
+---------
+
+This change will allow running userspace vSwitches using vhost-user
+interface. Both generic vhost-user vSwitches and OVS based vSwtiches
+will be supported.
+
+Project Priority
+----------------
+
+No
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+We propose to add VIF_VHOSTUSER to Nova for creating network
+interfaces based on vhost-user. This VIF type would be enabled by
+Neutron drivers by using portbindings extension and setting the
+vif_type to VIF_VHOSTUSER. To support both generic and ovs based
+vSwitches additional information will be passed in vif_details.
+For ovs based vSwitches plug/unplug methods will create/remove
+an ovs port if 'vhost_user_ovs_plug' is set to True in the vif_details.
+
+VIF_VHOSTUSER driver will allow Neutron mechanism drivers to specify
+if qemu should work in server or client mode. Mechanism drivers
+could pass 'vhost_user_mode' in vif_details to specify the mode.
+The name of the socket will be the same as ID of the Neutron port.
+For ovs based vSwitches name of the socket will be the same as name
+of the ovs port.
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+In Juno cycle there were two initiatives to support userspace vhost user
+in Nova. One was based on vhost-user interface in Qemu the other was based
+on DPDK implementation. Since DPDK is moving to support vhost-user only one
+driver is needed.
+
+Alternatively a mechanism for plugging in vif libvirt driver could be used
+to support
+vhost-user in libvirt driver. Such mechanism is proposed here:

+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+None.
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+None.
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+
+None.
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+
+None.
+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+
+None.
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+Use of VIF_VHOSTUSER will have no inpact on Openstack performance.
+Use of userspace vSwitch with vhost-user will improve guest network perforamce.
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+VIF_VHOSTUSER does not have to be enabled by the deployer. Neutron
+drivers will automatically enable VIF_VHOSTUSER via port binding if
+this is the appropriate choice for the agent on the compute host.
+
+VIF_VHOSTUSER will require a version of QEMU with vhost-user support,
+which is currently upstream and will be released in QEMU 2.1.
+
+VIF_VHOSTUSER will also require a version of Libvirt with vhost-user
+support.
+
+Developer impact
+----------------
+
+None.

+
+Work Items
+----------
+
+* Add VIF_VHOSTUSER support to Nova.
+
+Dependencies
+============
+
+An ml2 dpdk ovs driver is being proposed for Neutron.
+This feature doesn't directly depend on it.
+
+This feature depends on bp/virt-driver-large-pages.
+
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+VIF_VHOSTUSER will be tested by 3rd party CI for the DPDK Ovs mech driver.
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+No documentation changes for Nova are anticipated. VIF_VHOSTUSER will
+be automatically enabled by Neutron where appropriate.
