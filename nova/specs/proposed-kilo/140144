+======================================================
+Make key manager interface interoperable with Barbican
+======================================================
+
+URL to Launchpad blueprint:
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/encryption-with-barbican
+
+The volume encryption feature added in the Havana release currently can only
+operate with a single key that is hardcoded in.  A much more flexible and
+secure solution would be to generate and store keys in Barbican, a cohesive and
+secure Linux-based key management system
+https://github.com/cloudkeep/barbican/wiki, which is now in the OpenStack
+incubation process.
+
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+Problem 1: The OpenStack Volume Encryption feature currently cannot provide its
+designed level of security due to the absence of a key management service.
+Only a placeholder is available now, which isn't sufficient for the volume
+encryption feature to be used in an enterprise environment.  Keys cannot be
+stored, and only one hard-coded key is presented for all volumes. The proposed
+outcome would provide the ability to create and safely store dedicated keys for
+individual users or tenants.
+
+Problem 2: An ephemeral disk encryption feature supporting LVM was not accepted
+into the Icehouse release due to the lack of a key manager. For security
+reasons, since the disk is in close proximity to the virtual host, ephemeral
+disk encryption must use a key that's safely stored outside of the virtual host
+environment.
+
+An enterprise-grade key manager is needed for both cases, and Barbican
+(approved for incubation on 3/10/14) is becoming the default key manager that
+is slated to support OpenStack volume encryption, ephemeral disk storage
+encryption, and other potential security features.
+https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Barbican/Incubation. In order for Barbican to
+support these two storage encryption features, an interface between the
+existing key manager interface (nova/keymgr/key_mgr.py) used for volume
+encryption and the Barbican key manager needs to be developed.
+
+Use Cases
+---------
+
+Users who wish to use the OpenStack Volume Encryption feature currently don't
+have the ability to have encryption on a per-tenant basis.  It currently has
+a single unchangable key.  By adding the option of using the Barbican Key
+Manager, a separate key can be created and stored for each tenant. This makes
+the feature much more secure.
+
+Project Priority
+----------------
+
+N/A
+
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+Create an interface that will call python-barbicanclient, allowing Barbican to
+securely generate, store, and present encryption keys to Nova in support of the
+volume encryption feature.  The adapter will be a modification of the present
+key management abstraction layer in the volume encryption feature supporting
+block storage encryption on Cinder and ephemeral disk encryption.
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+Instead of implementing the existing key manager interface,
+python-barbicanclient could be invoked directly, but the additional indirection
+allows more extensibility if a different key manager needs to be integrated
+later.
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+None
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+None
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+
+Use of a bonafide key manager greatly improves the security posture of the
+volume encryption and upcoming ephemeral disk encryption features.  When each
+user or tenant use a unique key instead of a common key, and when it is stored
+in a separate server, it will be much more difficult for an attacker to access
+stored encrypted data owned by a user or group of collective users within a
+tenant.
+
+Though the wrapper will be handling encryption keys, the security risk is
+considered minimal since the host must be trusted, and the wrapper is only
+holding the key temporarily.
+
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+
+None
+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+
+None
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+The additional storage write and read time to initially query Barbican for the
+encryption key should be negligible.
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+Assuming that Barbican is the default key manager, then no impact.  If it's not
+the default, then a configuration flag in Nova will need to be added.
+
+Developer impact
+----------------
+
+None

+
+Work Items
+----------
+
+Develop simple translation of existing key manager interface methods (e.g.,
+get_key) into the corresponding python-barbicanclient calls.

+Dependencies

+None
+
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+Tempest testing should be performed to ensure that the wrapper works correctly.
+
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+The use of Barbican as the default key manager for the storage encryption will
+need to be documented.
