Subject: [PATCH] Use configdrive with Ironic

This blueprint adds support for configdrive for the Ironic virt driver,
to enable Nova to pass a configdrive to Ironic, to be used when
deploying a bare metal instance.

+===========================
+Use configdrive with Ironic
+===========================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/use-configdrive-with-ironic
+
+This blueprint adds support for configdrive for the Ironic virt driver, to
+enable Nova to pass a configdrive to Ironic, to be used when deploying a
+bare metal instance.
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+Instances deployed by Ironic should be able to use cloud-init (or similar
+software) to put an end user's data on an instance. This is possible today with
+Ironic by including cloud-init with the image, and pointing it at a Nova
+metadata service.
+
+There are two issues with this approach:
+
+* Some deployers do not run a metadata service in their environment.
+
+* If a deployer provisions Ironic machines using static IP address assignment,
+  the instance will not have network access until cloud-init puts the network
+  configuration into place. If the metadata service is the only way to get
+  the network configuration, the instance is deadlocked on getting network
+  access.
+
+To solve these problems, a configdrive image can take the place of the metadata
+service. In the VM world, this is typically handled by the hypervisor exposing
+a configdrive image to the VM as a volume.
+
+In Ironic's case, there is no hypervisor, so this image needs to be exposed to
+the instance in some other fashion. This could be accomplished by writing the
+image to a partition on the node, exposing the image via the out-of-band
+mechanism (e.g. a virtual floppy in HP's iLO), or configuring the node to mount
+the image from a SAN. In any case, this needs to be handled by Ironic, rather
+than Nova. However, Nova has the data that belongs in the configdrive, as well
+as the code to generate the image. So, it makes sense for Nova to generate an
+image and pass it to Ironic.
+
+Use Cases
+---------
+
+The main use case here is feature parity with other virt drivers. Other
+drivers support configdrive today, and deployers use it. Deployers of
+Ironic should also be able to use configdrives.
+
+There are two main use cases as described above:
+
+* Deployers that do not use the metadata service.
+
+* Deployers that wish to use static IP assignment, where the instance
+  will not have network access to get to the metadata service.
+
+Project Priority
+----------------
+
+The kilo priorities list is currently not defined, however "virt driver
+feature parity" seems important.
+
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+Nova should generate the configdrive image and pass it to Ironic, if needed.
+This should use the existing code (nova.virt.configdrive:required_by) to
+determine if a configdrive should be generated.
+
+This will consist of these steps:
+
+* The Ironic virt driver decides if a configdrive should be generated for this
+  instance. If so:
+
+* The virt driver generates the configdrive and gzips it.
+
+* The virt driver puts the gzipped image in some system and holds on to
+  a URI for the image.
+
+* The virt driver will pass this URI to Ironic.
+
+* If present, Ironic will pass this URI to its DeployDriver, which will
+  in turn provide it to the instance during provisioning, by means appropriate
+  to that driver.
+
+* Ironic uses this URI to write a configdrive partition on the
+  instance during provisioning.
+
+* The reference implementation for this will be using Swift, with a
+  configurable TTL.
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+The only alternative to solving the problems described above, is to write
+network configuration and user data directly to the image to be deployed, on
+the fly. I think it is suffice to say that Ironic should not be in the business
+of injecting files directly into images, nor should we force end users to
+use custom images with this data already injected.
+
+As mentioned before, Ironic's drivers may provide various mechanisms for
+exposing this image to the instance. However, no matter the mechanism used,
+the interaction will be the same from Nova's perspective.
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+None.
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+None.
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+
+This proposal involves storing end user data in Swift. This may be a security
+concern, as this data is not encrypted at rest.
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+
+None.
+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+
+None.
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+Generating the configdrive image and sending it to another service will cause
+Nova to spend more time in Ironic's virt driver, although the additional time
+spent should be relatively small.
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+The reference implementation will add a hard dependency on Swift for
+deployers that wish to use configdrive support with Ironic. Other
+implementations may remove this dependency.
+
+The reference implementation will also add corresponding config options
+for the Swift client.
+
+Developer impact
+----------------
+
+None.
+
+
+Implementation
+==============
+
+Assignee(s)
+-----------
+
+Primary assignee:
+  jroll
+
+Work Items
+----------
+
+* Add a wrapper for python-swiftclient that can, at a minimum, upload objects
+  to Swift.
+
+* Implement the code and unit tests. This will involve changing the deploy()
+  function in Ironic's virt driver to generate the configdrive, upload
+  it to Swift, and pass the Swift URL for the configdrive in the PATCH
+  request to Ironic. The tear_down() method of Ironic's virt driver will
+  be changed to remove the configdrive key from instance_info. Unit tests will
+  need to be updated accordingly.
+
+* Configure tempest tests to properly exercise this feature.
+
+
+Dependencies
+============
+
+This change depends on Ironic support for writing the configdrive to the
+instance. [1]
+
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+Use tempest to test this feature, when configured properly.
+
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+Documentation may need to be updated to indicate that a configdrive may
+be used with bare metal instances.
