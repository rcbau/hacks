+====================================================================
+ Refactor ISCSIDriver to support other iSCSI transports besides TCP
+====================================================================
+
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/add-transport-support-to-iscsi
+
+Currently open-iscsi in openstack does not allow the use of offload iscsi
+transports (cxgb4i, qla4xx, bnx2i etc) or other software iscsi transports
+(like iser). This blueprint aims to add support for this
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+open-iscsi has hardware iSCSI transport support. The interface argument
+specifies the hardware iSCSI interface to use for the operation. Any hardware
+vendors that currently  provide hardware interfaces for open-iscsi cannot use
+them in  openstack as the interfaces (iface) argument is not currently
+supported in the iSCSI driver.
+
+While this effort is being done by Chelsio, the approach is currently to make
+it generic enough for all supported HBAs (Host Bus Adapter).
+
+Use of such iSCSI hardware transports requires providing a corresponding
+interface file (referred to as iface), which can be autogenerated via iscsiadm
+but need correctness checks or can also be generated on the fly, given the
+3-tuple of ipaddress, hwaddress & transport name to be used. The iface format
+itself is generic and does not use any propreitary fields irrespective of
+transport being used.
+
+This will also enable use of iSER directly through the iSCSI driver, though
+deprecating the iSER driver is not the aim of this spec, and will probably
+start with iSER disabled, serving as ground work for this spec :

+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/cinder/+spec/add-transport-support-to-iscsi
+
+Use Cases
+----------
+
+User has an HBA that supports hardware iSCSI installed in his system. Using
+open-iscsi's hardware transport support allows for iSCSI communication at
+higher speeds and reduced CPU usage.
+
+Current transports supported by open-iscsi are :
+* Chelsio : cxgb3i, cxgb4i
+* QLogic : qla4xxx, bnx2i (formerly Broadcom)
+* Emulex : be2iscsi, ocs
+* Mellanox & others : iser
+
+Use of any of these transports requires the appropriate hardware to be present
+in the system, but iSER will not be supported at the very start.
+
+Project Priority
+-----------------
+
+Nova doesn't have any priorities set, but this would fall under performance.
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+On the initiator side the only difference between using software iSCSI and
+hardware iSCSI transport is the interface flag (--interface=[iface])
+
+e.g. "iscsiadm -m discovery -t st -p ip:port -I <iface file>"
+
+iface files can automatically be generated for all hardware present on a
+system that is supported by open-iscsi by 'iscsiadm -m iface'. The default
+format for iface file names is in the form <transport_name.hw_address>
+
+The default iface name is 'default'. Not using the -I parameter (which is how
+open-iscsi  is currently being used in nova) is the same as specifying
+
+'iscsiadm -m discovery -t st -p ip:port -I default'
+
+Required changes are :
+
+* A new parameter to specify which transport should be used while doing iscsi
+  discovery/login, falling back to TCP if operation does not succeed, or if
+  parameter is not provided (-I default)
+* An alternative (but lot more complicated ) approach might be to figure out
+  iface name from source ip address. ipaddress can be used to figure out
+  hwaddress and pci dev id. pci dev id provides transport name, iface names
+  are in the format <transportname>.<hwaddress>
+
+Other related changes :
+
+* Verify hardware exists before attempting to use said transport. The best
+  way to accomplish this is checking PCI vendor ids/MAC address if nova would
+  be open to accepting such code.
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+Use manual discovery of iscsi-targets, and provide -I parameter when doing
+discovery. Transport names are written in the resultant records generated by
+open-iscsi, however this can be does not guarantee hardware transports will
+be used.
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+None
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+None
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+
+None
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+
+None
+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+iSCSI performance is improved drastically, no extra commands are added to
+driver, except perhaps one to generate the default iface files :
+'iscsiadm -m iface'
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+This could be used as a stepping stone to eventually remove
+LibvirtISERVolumeDriver as  'iscsiadm -I iser' can be used for iSER support.
+
+Developer impact
+----------------
+
+None
+
+Implementation
+==============
+
+Assignee(s)
+-----------
+
+Assignee : anish7 <anish@chelsio.com>
+
+Work Items
+----------
+
+* Add -I parameter to all iscsiadm login/discovery commands in
+  'nova/virt/libvirt/volume.py'
+* Add transport parameter to config options, which defaults to software iscsi
+  i.e. '-I default'
+
+Dependencies
+============
+
+None as such. However, the minimum information required for using a tansport
+if it is not already configured is a 3 tuple of ip, transport name & hardware
+address. Functionality to this effect would be good to have for automatic
+configuration of transports.
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+Current iSCSI tests will work just fine. Will be testing on Chelsio hardware,
+and any other transport supporting hardware that can be obtained.
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+New transport parameter will need relevant documentation.
