Subject: [PATCH] Using cinder volumes backed by VMware raw devices

OpenStack currently lacks support for attaching VMware
raw devices to Virtual machines. This blueprint allows
users to attach and detach cinder volumes backed by
VMware raw devices.

+Attaching and detaching cinder volumes backed by VMware raw devices
+===================================================================

+
+In VMware, Raw Device Mapping(RDM) is a method to provide direct access to a
+LUN on a iscsi or fibre channel storage system for a virtual machine.
+OpenStack currently lacks support for attaching VMware raw devices to virtual
+machines. This blueprint allows users to use these cinder volumes backed by
+VMware raw devices. The volumes created through the VMware RDM cinder driver
+are only available in a VMware VCenter environment and can only be attached
+to VMware virtual machines. The proposed extension is limited to the VMware
+hypervisor driver only.
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+RDM is a mapping file in a separate VMFS volume that acts as a proxy for
+a raw physical storage device. The RDM allows a virtual machine to directly
+access and use the storage device. The RDM contains metadata for managing
+and redirecting disk access to the physical device. A cinder driver for
+VMware volumes backed by raw devices provides basic volume management
+operations. This blueprint proposes a extensions to the nova VMware driver
+to allow users to attach and detach those volumes.
+
+Use Cases
+----------
+
+The EndUser will be able to attach and detach VMware cinder volumes backed by
+raw devices

+Project Priority

+None
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+Extend the nova VMware driver to support the following operations with cinder
+VMware volumes backed by raw devices:
+* attach volume to an instance
+* detach volume from an instance
+
+The first time a volume is attached to a virtual machine using
+"nova volume-attach" an available device is selected and the volume
+is decorated with the LUN UUID of the selected device. When the volume
+is detached from a virtual machine, the LUN UUID will be preserved,
+so that the next attachment involving the volume will use the same device.
