Subject: [PATCH] Adds spec for Hyper-V instance hot resize

https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/hyper-v-hot-resize

In Windows Hyper-V / Server 2012 R2 a new feature was introduced,
allowing users to resize both memory and local disks (but not vCPUs)
of the VMs while they are still running. Because of this,
no down time for the spawned instances is necessary when
nova resize is performed on the same host.

Implements: blueprint hyper-v-hot-resize

+Hyper-V: Instance hot resize
+============================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/hyper-v-hot-resize
+
+In Windows Hyper-V / Server 2012 R2 a new feature was introduced, allowing
+users to resize both memory and local disks (but not vCPUs) of the VMs while
+they are still running. Because of this, no down time for the spawned instances
+is necessary when nova resize is performed on the same host.
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+The main disadvantage for resizing an instance is the required down time
+necessary to do so. This spec will allow users to resize their Hyper-V
+instances while they are still running.
+
+Use Cases
+----------
+
+There are 2 use cases, depending on what OS the nova-compute service is
+running on:
+
+* Windows Hyper-V / Server 2012 R2 / Windows 8.1:
+  * Virtual hard disks can be hot resized.
+  * Memory can be hot resized, if the VM has Dynamic Memory enabled.
+
+* Windows Hyper-V / Server 10 Technical Preview or newer:
+  * Virtual hard disks can be hot resized.
+  * Memory can be hot resized, even if Dynamic Memory is not enabled.
+
+For more details regarding the hot resize, check the sources [1], [2] and [3].
+
+In any case, changing the number of vCPUs on a live instance is not supported,
+which implies that a cold resize will be performed.
+
+There are a few restrictions that apply to this feature, as mentioned in the
+references:
+* Any existing constraints (e.g.: disk downsizing is not admitted).
+* Dynamic Memory must be enabled, if the nova-compute service runs on
+  Windows Hyper-V / Server 2012 R2 / Windows 8.1.
+* The disk format must be VHDX.
+* For disk hot resize, the disk to be resized must be attached to a SCSI
+  controller and the instance must be a Generation 2 VM. [4]
+* The resize must occur on the same host.
+
+Project Priority
+-----------------
+
+None
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+There are a few changes that needs to be applied to the Hyper-V driver in order
+to support this feature:
+* Add virtual hard disk online resize support to a subclass of VHDUtilsV2,
+  which will be used in Windows Hyper-V / Server 2012 R2 or newer.
+* Add support for memory resize in a subclass of VMUtilsV2, which will be used
+  in Windows Hyper-V / Server 10 Technical Preview or newer.
+* Add the appropriate changes to utilsfactory to accommodate the new utils
+  classes mentioned above.
+
+If hot resize is not applicable because of the restrictions defined in the
+'Use Cases' section above, cold resize is performed instead, meaning there
+would be no change in functionality.
+
+If a hot resize is appropriate, during resize, the Hyper-V driver must:
+* migrate_disk_and_power_off:
+  *Avoid stoping and destroying the instance.
+* finish_migration:
+  * Avoid creating another ephemeral disk.
+  * Avoid creating a new instance and attaching a config drive to it, since it
+    was never destroyed.
+  * Avoid starting the instance, since it was never stoped.
+  * Perform hot resize.
+* finish_revert_migration:
+  * Avoid creating a new instance and attaching a config drive to it, since it
+    was never destroyed.
+  * Avoid starting the instance, since it was never stoped.
+
+If hot resize is appropriate, the following changes to ComputeManager's
+resize_instance method should be considered:
+* It should not terminate the connection for any of the instance's volumes,
+since they are still in use and the instance can actively use them.
+* Since the resize occurs on the same host, avoid calling finish_resize through
+compute_rpcapi and call the method locally.

+Alternatives
+------------
+
+None
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+None
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+None, the user will use the same command as before.
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+
+None
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+
+None
+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+
+The guest OS must have a mechanism to detect when the disk size changes in
+order to do a "growroot" style operation. At the moment, cloud-init and
+cloudbase-init performs this check on boot.
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+None
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+To use this feature, the users will have to enable it from the compute node's
+nova.conf, setting the config option hyperv.allow_live_resize‚Äè to True.
+
+Developer impact
+----------------
+
+None

+Work Items
+----------
+
+As described in the 'Proposed change' section.
+
+Dependencies
+============
+
+None
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+CI testing will be performed by Hyper-V CI.
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+The possibility to perform hot resize on Hyper-V instances will be documented,
+as well as the config option for Hyper-V.
