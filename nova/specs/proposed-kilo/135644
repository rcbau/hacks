+Cells instance mapping
+==========================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/cells-instance-mapping
+
+In order for compute api nodes to communicate with the correct cell for an
+instance there will need to be a mapping of instance to cell.  A new table will
+be created which can store this mapping.
+
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+When Nova is partitioned into cells, the compute api needs to know which cell
+to communicate with for a particular instance.  There is currently no mapping
+of instance to cell in which it lives.
+
+Use Cases
+----------
+
+* Operators want to partition their deployments into cells for scaling, failure
+  domain, and buildout reasons.  When partitioned, we need a lookup table to
+  know which partition an instance is in.
+
+Project Priority
+-----------------
+
+Cells v2 has been made a project priority for Kilo.
+
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+The change being proposed is a new table for storing a mapping of instance to
+cell.  The database APIs and objects that interact with this table will be
+updated to use it.  Migration of data into this table will be tackled in a
+separate spec.
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+We could continue to use the nova-cells model in place today.  The downsides of
+this have been discussed in the etherpad link in the references section.
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+A new 'instance_mapping' table will be added.  And it should be added to the
+'nova_api' database.
+
+The table will look approximately like:
+
+CREATE TABLE `instance_mapping` (
+  `created_at` datetime DEFAULT NULL,
+  `updated_at` datetime DEFAULT NULL,
+  `deleted_at` datetime DEFAULT NULL,
+  `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
+  `instance_uuid` varchar(36) NOT NULL,
+  `cell_uuid` varchar(36) NOT NULL,
+  `project_id` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
+  `deleted` int(11) DEFAULT NULL)
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+None
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+
+None
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+
+None
+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+
+None
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+On its own this change does not introduce a performance impact.  When it's used
+by later specs it does introduce another database lookup for many actions
+within Nova.  For example a 'nova show <uuid>' will require Nova to look up the
+database that an instance is in before it can query it for instance data.  This
+can be optimized later with a memcached cache of this mapping.
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+This introduces a new table into the 'nova_api' database.
+
+Developer impact
+----------------
+
+Developers should be beginning to see that all instances in a deployment may
+not be in the same database.  But no development changes should necessary at
+this point.

+
+* Add database migration for 'instance_mapping' table.

+
+Dependencies
+============

+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/cells-v2-mapping
+
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+Since this is designed to be an internal re-architecting of Nova with no user
+visible changes the current suite of Tempest or functional tests should
+suffice.  At some point we will want to look at how to test multiple cells or
+potentially exposing the concept of a cell in the API and we will tackle
+testing requirements then.
+
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+Documentation should be added about the new table and what its usage will be.
