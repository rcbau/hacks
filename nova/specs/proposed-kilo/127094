Subject: [PATCH] Display user and project limits

Today the limits API (i.e. nova absolute-limits) only returns
the project limits.  It is useful for the end user to know both
the user and project limits, especially when the end user is
trying to understand how much capacity is used versus how much
capacity is available.

+
+Today the limits API (i.e. nova absolute-limits) only returns the project
+limits.  It is useful for the end user to know the user limits as well,
+especially when the end user is trying to understand how much capacity is
+used versus how much capacity is available.  Today the end user would have to
+make separate requests in order to obtain both user and project limits and
+combine the results to get an overall picture.  Not only that, it is confusing
+to see just one set of limits at a time (user or project).

+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+Today the limits API (i.e. nova absolute-limits) only returns the project
+limit.  It is confusing to see just one set of limits at a time (user or
+project), especially when the end user is trying to understand how much
+capacity is used versus how much capacity is available.
+
+Take for example the following situations:
+
+* The project quota is reached, but the user quota still shows capacity is
+  available.
+
+* The user quota is reached, but the project quota still shows capacity is
+  available.
+
+It is necessary to display both the user and project limits in order to
+understand the true user and project limits, and understand which one should
+be increased.
+
+
+Use Cases
+----------
+
+As an end user, I want to see both the user and project limits.  It is
+confusing to see just one set of limits at a time (user or project), such as
+in the case where you hit one set of limits (e.g. project), but there is
+capacity in the other set of limits (e.g. user).
+
+Project Priority
+-----------------
+
+This falls within "Improved python client".  It would provide a better end
+user experience by providing both the user and project limits.
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+Both user and project limits should be included when using the limits
+API.  The user quota limit should be included in the response for any limits
+request.
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+None
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+None
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+A new v2 API extension will be created to show both user and project limits.
+If the extension is not enabled, then only project limits will be shown. For
+later microversion of v2.1 API, both user and project limits should be shown.
+
+The v2 extension is as follows ::
+
+    {
+        "alias": "os-aggregate-limits",
+        "description": "Provide data on resource limits that are imposed on "
+            "both the project and user.",
+        "links": [],
+        "name": "AggregateLimits",
+        "namespace": "http://docs.openstack.org/compute/ext/"
+            "aggregate_limits/api/v1.1"
+    }
+
+When the new extension "os-aggregate-limits" is loaded, a new field
+'user_absolute' will be added to the limits API as follows ::
+
+    {"limits": {
+      "absolute": {
+        "maxServerMeta": 128,
+        "maxPersonality": 5,
+        "totalServerGroupsUsed": 0,
+        "maxImageMeta": 128,
+        "maxPersonalitySize": 10240,
+        "maxTotalRAMSize": 51200,
+        "maxTotalKeypairs": 100,
+        "maxSecurityGroupRules": 20,
+        "maxServerGroups": 10,
+        "totalCoresUsed": 0,
+        "totalRAMUsed": 0,
+        "maxSecurityGroups": 10,
+        "totalFloatingIpsUsed": 0,
+        "totalInstancesUsed": 0,
+        "totalSecurityGroupsUsed": 1,
+        "maxTotalFloatingIps": 10,
+        "maxTotalInstances": 10,
+        "maxTotalCores": 20,
+        "maxServerGroupMembers": 10
+      },
+      "user_absolute": {
+        "maxServerMeta": 128,
+        "maxPersonality": 5,
+        "totalServerGroupsUsed": 0,
+        "maxImageMeta": 128,
+        "maxPersonalitySize": 10240,
+        "maxTotalRAMSize": 10240,
+        "maxTotalKeypairs": 100,
+        "maxSecurityGroupRules": 20,
+        "maxServerGroups": 10,
+        "totalCoresUsed": 0,
+        "totalRAMUsed": 0,
+        "maxSecurityGroups": 1,
+        "totalFloatingIpsUsed": 0,
+        "totalInstancesUsed": 0,
+        "totalSecurityGroupsUsed": 1,
+        "maxTotalFloatingIps": 2,
+        "maxTotalInstances": 2,
+        "maxTotalCores": 4,
+        "maxServerGroupMembers": 10
+      }
+    }}
+
+The user_absolute will be obtained by making a call to QUOTAS.get_user_quotas.

+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+
+This change impacts the python-novaclient.  Before this change, user and
+project limits had to be queried separately as follows.
+
+$ nova quota-show
++-----------------------------+-------+
+| Quota                       | Limit |
++-----------------------------+-------+

+| ram                         | 10240 |
+| floating_ips                | 2     |
+| fixed_ips                   | -1    |
+| metadata_items              | 128   |
+| injected_files              | 5     |

++-----------------------------+-------+
+
+$ nova absolute-limits
++-------------------------+-------+
+| Name                    | Value |
++-------------------------+-------+
+| maxServerMeta           | 128   |
+| maxPersonality          | 5     |
+| totalServerGroupsUsed   | 0     |
+| maxImageMeta            | 128   |
+| maxPersonalitySize      | 10240 |
+| maxTotalRAMSize         | 51200 |
+| maxTotalKeypairs        | 100   |
+| maxSecurityGroupRules   | 20    |
+| maxServerGroups         | 10    |
+| totalCoresUsed          | 0     |
+| totalRAMUsed            | 0     |
+| maxSecurityGroups       | 10    |
+| totalFloatingIpsUsed    | 0     |
+| totalInstancesUsed      | 0     |
+| totalSecurityGroupsUsed | 0     |
+| maxTotalFloatingIps     | 10    |
+| maxTotalInstances       | 10    |
+| maxTotalCores           | 20    |
+| maxServerGroupMembers   | 10    |
++-------------------------+-------+
+
+It should be noted that the field names in the output of "nova quota-show" is
+different from those in "nova absolute-limits", but they are mapped as
+follows ::
+
+    "ram": "maxTotalRAMSize"
+    "instances": "maxTotalInstances"
+    "cores": "maxTotalCores"
+    "key_pairs": "maxTotalKeypairs"
+    "floating_ips": "maxTotalFloatingIps"
+    "metadata_items": "maxServerMeta"
+    "injected_files": "maxPersonality"
+    "injected_file_content_bytes": "maxPersonalitySize"
+    "security_groups": "maxSecurityGroups"
+    "security_group_rules": "maxSecurityGroupRules"
+
+With this change, both user and project limits can be queried using one
+command, nova absolute-limits.  A new column will be added to show the user
+limits.
+
+$ nova absolute-limits
++-------------------------+-------+---------+
+| Name                    | User  | Project |
++-------------------------+-------+---------+

+| maxPersonality          | 5     | 5       |
+| totalServerGroupsUsed   | 0     | 0       |
+| maxImageMeta            | 128   | 128     |
+| maxPersonalitySize      | 10240 | 10240   |

+
+Work Items
+----------
+
+* Modify python-novaclient to print out the new user limit column
+
+* Create v2 API extension and modify LimitsController in
+  nova/api/openstack/compute/limits.py to call QUOTAS.get_user_quotas
+  (if the extension is loaded) to add the user limits to the output
+
+* Add tempest test cases to verify that the user and project quotas are
+  included in the response to the limits API
+
+Dependencies
+============
+
+None
+
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+New tempest test cases, as well as nova unit test cases, will be added to
+verify that the user and project limits are included in the response to the
+limits API.
+
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+This will change the output of the limits API.  If the end user is using the
+python-novaclient, they will see a new column added to show the user limits.
+If the end user is using the REST API, they will notice the user_absolute
+field added to the GET response.
