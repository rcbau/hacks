+Host health monitoring
+======================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/host-health-monitoring
+
+Provide check for the host condition, instead of compute service check.
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+For the time being, there is no way to distinguish between two really different
+things: host status and nova-compute status, which is deployed on the host.
+
+Also, provided host information by API and commands, are service centric - i.e.
+``nova host-list`` is just another wrapper for ``nova service-list`` with
+different format (in fact ``service-list`` is superset to ``host-list``). Seems
+like nova is treating *host* term equally to *compute-host*, which might be
+misleading. Such situation can be error prone for the case where there is a
+need to perform host evacuation.
+
+Use Cases
+---------
+
+As an End User, I want to get clear information about host state separately
+from certain service state. With such knowledge I can than perform appropriate
+actions, without it I can fail the evacuation like in the scenario described in
+`nova evacuate --on-shared-storage doesn't check actual vm state`_ bug.
+
+Project Priority
+----------------
+
+Bugs
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+Instead of treating servicegroup existence of ``compute`` node as a host alive
+indicator, introduce new servicegroup API call for the host check.
+
+Idea is, that there would be check of the status of the services for provided
+host name. If there is at least one with state up, that will mean the host is
+up. If all of the servicegroups nodes doesn't contain the provided host name,
+means the host is down.
+
+Appropriate logic will go into servicegroup API, as new method to get host
+state information, and REST API will be affected as well.
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+The other way to get the information is to introduce new node ``hosts`` within
+servicegroup and append the hostname under it - so there would be only one
+place to look for the host state. Drawback of that approach would be, that
+implementation will affect servicegroup driver implementations, and complicate
+``join()`` method for all of them.
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+None
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+Modify ``HostController`` method ``index`` to include also information about
+hosts state.
+
+
+
+So the call to ``/v2/{tenant-id}/os-hosts{?service,zone}`` would have changed
+output which may looks like this::
+
+   GET /
+   {
+       "hosts": [
+           {
+               "host_name": "some.host.name",
+               "service": "compute",
+               "state": "up",
+               "zone": "internal"
+           },
+           {
+               "host_name": "some.host.name",
+               "service": "network",
+               "state": "up",
+               "zone": "internal"
+           },
+           {
+               "host_name": "some.other.host.name",
+               "service": "compute",
+               "state": "down",
+               "zone": "internal"
+           },
+           {
+               "host_name": "some.other.host.name",
+               "service": "network",
+               "state": "down",
+               "zone": "internal"
+           }
+       ]
+   }
+
+Note, that since this is requested host-centric information, the new state
+information applies to the host, and by accident to the services - even if the
+``compute`` service is down for ``some.host.name``.
