+====================
+Create VIF_VHOSTUSER
+====================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/vif-vhostuser
+
+We propose to add a new VIF type to support the new QEMU vhost-user
+feature. vhost-user is a new QEMU feature that supports efficient
+Virtio-net I/O between a guest and a user-space vswitch. vhost-user is
+the userspace equivalent to /dev/vhost-net and is based on a Unix
+socket for communication instead of a kernel device file.
+
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+QEMU has a new type of network interface, vhost-user, and we want to
+make this available to Neutron drivers. This will support deploying
+high-throughput userspace vswitches for OpenStack-based NFV
+applications. (This is the reason that vhost-user was developed.)
+
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+This change defines nova.network.model.VIF_TYPE_VHOSTUSER.
+
+We propose to add VIF_VHOSTUSER to Nova for creating network
+interfaces based on vhost-user. This VIF type would be enabled by
+Neutron drivers that want to assign certain ports to a userspace agent
+(vswitch) that is based on vhost-user.
+
+VIF_VHOSTUSER is to be implemented by extending the Libvirt driver.
+Libvirt support for vhost-user is currently under review and we expect
+it to be merged in time for Juno. We see that upstream Libvirt support
+for vhost-user is a dependency for merging the VIF_VHOSTUSER
+implementation into Nova.
+
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+Intel DPDK has a separate mechanism for accessing vhost from
+userspace, based on replacing /dev/vhost-net with a FUSE-based device
+file that traps ioctls into userspace. However, vhost-user is the new
+standard way to achieve this and is upstream in QEMU.
+

+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+None.
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+None.
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+
+None.
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+
+None.
+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+
+None.
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+vhost-user will make OpenStack compatible with vswitches supporting N
+x 10G Virtio-net workloads.
+
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+VIF_VHOSTUSER does not have to be enabled by the deployer. Neutron
+drivers will automatically enable VIF_VHOSTUSER via port binding if
+this is the appropriate choice for the agent on the compute host.
+
+VIF_VHOSTUSER will require a version of QEMU with vhost-user support,
+which is currently upstream and will be released in QEMU 2.1.
+
+VIF_VHOSTUSER will also require a version of Libvirt with vhost-user
+support.
+
+Developer impact
+----------------
+
+None.

+
+Work Items
+----------
+
+* Add vhost-user support to the Libvirt driver.
+* Add VIF_VHOSTUSER support to Nova.
+
+Dependencies
+============
+
+* Libvirt must add support for vhost-user. Current patch under review:
+  http://www.redhat.com/archives/libvir-list/2014-July/msg00111.html
+
+* VIF_VHOSTUSER will enable the Neutron driver for Snabb NFV:
+  https://blueprints.launchpad.net/neutron/+spec/snabb-nfv-mech-driver
+  http://snabb.co/nfv.html
+  http://github.com/SnabbCo/snabbswitch
+
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+VIF_VHOSTUSER will be Tempest-tested by the planned 3rd party CI
+integration for the Snabb NFV mech driver.
+
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+No documentation changes for Nova are anticipated. VIF_VHOSTUSER will
+be automatically enabled by Neutron where appropriate.
