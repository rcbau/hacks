+Validate target host for live migration
+===========================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/validate-targethost-live-migration
+
+The aim of this feature is to let nova scheduler evaluate the scheduler hints
+when live migrate a VM with target host.
+
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+At the moment, for live migration with target host, the current implementation
+is that once target host was specified for live migration, the conductor only
+validates the host by nova compute.
+
+For some cases, there is also a need to validate the host in nova scheduler,
+as there might be some requirement that admin wants to validate the target host
+for live migration with scheduler hints and filters.
+
+In the current implementation the user can specify scheduler hints related to
+the placement of the instance. Those scheduler hints are used when the
+instance run for the first time and they are ignored afterwards. In order to
+achieve the validation of the target host we need to persist scheduler hints
+into the database which makes it possible to verify that the target host
+passes scheduler filters/hints during live migration.
+
+There are some cases when this verification during live migration will lead
+the system locked and the user will not be able to migrate an instance, so a
+new option should be added in order to force the migration without verifying
+the target host by nova-scheduler.
+
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+Modify the current live migration work flow to let the scheduler verify the
+scheduler hints and filters when live migration with a target host.

+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+None
+
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+* Enable ignores scheduler validation for both V2/V3 API.
+    * Request body::
+
+        {
+            "os-migrateLive": {
+                "host": "0443e9a1254044d8b99f35eace132080",
+                "block_migration": false,
+                "disk_over_commit": false,
+                "scheduler_validation": true
+            }
+        }
+
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+None
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+None
+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+
+python-novaclient will be modified to have scheduler_validation option when
+live migrate a VM instance with target host.
+
+The user can enable scheduler validation by:
+nova live-migration server --scheduler_validation

+
+Work Items
+----------
+
+* Add validation logic in live migration task.
+* Add validation logic in nova scheduler for scheduler hints/filters.
+* Add logic to make validation optional for both V2/V3 API.
+
+
+Dependencies
+============
+
+For a complete use-case the following bp will be required
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/persist-scheduler-hints,
+since we can retrieve the original scheduler hints from that a particular
+instance and let the scheduler validate the scheduler hints for live
+migration with target host.
+
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+* Add unit test for validation logic related to live migration task.
+* Add unit test for validation logic related to nova scheduler.
+* Add unit test for validation logic related to V2/V3 API.
+
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+* Api Docs to reflect the new scheduler_validation option for live migration.
+  If not present in the body the new feature will be ignored.
+* Client docs ( due to the new added live migration option).
+* Admin User Guide on live migration topic.
