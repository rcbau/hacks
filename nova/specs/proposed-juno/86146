Subject: [PATCH] Force Encrypted Live Migration thru Nova API

The goal of this Blueprint is to allow admins to force "encrypted" Live
Migration (LM) thru Nova API. This will leverage and allow admins to use
encryption in Live Migrations everywhere; especially for cases where no
encryption has been set in configuration files and without the need to
manually update and restart nodes/services.

The proposal is to modify Nova API once for exposing this option for the
different virtualization drivers, and initially to implement this option for
libvirt driver making use of libvirt tunneling.

+Force encrypted Live Migration thru Nova API
+============================================
+

+
+The goal of this Blueprint is to allow admins to force "encrypted" Live
+Migration (LM) thru Nova API. This will leverage and allow admins to use
+encryption in Live Migrations everywhere; especially for cases where no
+encryption has been set in configuration files and without the need to
+manually update and restart nodes/services.
+
+The proposal is to modify Nova API once for exposing this option for the
+different virtualization drivers, and initially to implement this option for
+libvirt driver making use of libvirt tunneling.
+
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+As described in OpenStack Security Guide, associated Risks of plain text Live
+migration include (see references Section for details):
+
+* Data Exposure. Memory or disk transfers must be handled securely.
+
+* Data Manipulation. If memory or disk transfers are not handled securely then
+  an attacker could manipulate user data during the migration.
+
+* Code Injection. If memory or disk transfers are not handled securely, then
+  an attacker could manipulate executables, either on disk or in memory,
+  during the migration.
+
+Currently Live Migration encryption can only be configured in nova.conf for
+libvirt tunneling. For cases where the admin does not know/missed/forgot
+configuring encryption in configuration files and encryption desired to be
+used afterwards nodes services are required to be manually modified/restarted.
+Considering a deployment with high number of nodes this may lead to not using
+encryption at all (given possible availability/performance considerations).
+So this new option leverages, facilitates and offers more flexibility in the
+setup and usage of encryption during Live Migration.
+
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+For exposing this force encryption option in Live Migration it is required to
+expose this in Nova APIs, by adding a new "force_migration_encryption"
+parameter:
+
+* Add this new parameter in the different method signatures for Nova Compute,
+  Nova Conductor and Nova Client (see API impact section for details). This
+  parameter will be passed all along these components until reaching a
+  specific virt driver where this parameter will be used.
+
+* Add the same "force_migration_encryption" in virt/driver.py abstract
+  live_migration method, setting its default to None.
+
+* libvirt/driver.py _live_migrate method to be modified for setting tunneled
+  option if the "force_migration_encryption" flag is set: "flags" parameter in
+  call to migrateToURI to contain: VIR_MIGRATE_TUNNELLED and
+  VIR_MIGRATE_PEER2PEER.
+
+* If VIR_MIGRATE_TUNNELLED and VIR_MIGRATE_PEER2PEER were set in nova.conf
+  then the encryption flags will be set in the migrateToURI as of today,
+  independently if "force_migration_encryption" parameter is set or not.
+
+* Force encryption option is to be applied where available by the different
+  virt driver and if compatible with other configurations (i.e. libvirt
+  tunneled live migration is only possible if block_migration is not used).
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+Currently, such functionality can only be accessed through manual
+configuration of libvirt, as described in OpenStack Security Guide:
+http://docs.openstack.org/security-guide/content/ch055_security-services-for-instances.html#ch055_security-services-for-instances-idp191072
+
+with additional comments in the following OSSN:
+https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/OSSN/OSSN-0007
+
+Tunneling of migration traffic does not apply to live block migration.
+
+Allowing to force Live Migration Encryption would facilitate and leverage the
+usage of Live Migration thru encrypted communication.
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+None
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+There are not changes in the URI for live_migration:
+
+/v2/{tenant_id}/servers/{server_id}/action
+/v3/servers/​{server_id}​/action/​{server_id}​/action
+
+In the JSON request a new additional property "force_migration_encryption" is
+added::
+
+    {
+        "os-migrateLive": {
+            "host": "0443e9a1254044d8b99f35eace132080",
+            "block_migration": false,
+            "disk_over_commit": false,
+            "force_migration_encryption": false
+        }
+    }
+
+Initially there have been identified the following API/methods in Nova
+Compute, Conductor, Nova Client and virt/libvirt where the new
+"force_migration_encryption" parameter needs to be added:
+
+Nova Compute:
+
+* nova/compute/api.py: live_migrate()
+
+* nova/compute/rpcapi.py: live_migration()
+
+* nova/compute/manaper.py: live_migration()
+
+Nova Conductor:
+
+* nova/conductor/api.py: live_migrate_instance()
+
+* nova/conductor/manager.py: migrate_server()
+
+* nova.conductor.manager.py: _live_migrate()
+
+* nova/conductor/tasks/live_migrate.py: execute()
+
+virt/libvirt:
+
+* nova/virt/driver.py: live_migration()
+
+* nova/virt/libvirt/driver.py: live_migration()
+
+* nova/virt/libvirt/driver.py: _live_migration()
+
+Nova Client:
+
+* pyhton-novaclient/novaclient/version/server.py: live_migrate()
+
+Parameter "force_migration_encryption" is initially to be added by default as
+None for not broking compatibility with other modules not using it.
+
+At this point there has not been identified a need to modify
+check_can_live_migrate_destination methods to add this new parameter.
+
+Initially no new error codes identified to be added.
+
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+
+This is an enhancement in the Security configuration for Live Migration.
+Nova API is modified for allowing to force encrypted Live Migration in
+case this has not been set in configuration file for the nodes used during
+the Live Migration process.
+
+Encryption thru libvirt tunneling is only enabled initially, but the involved
+abstract driver methods are modified for this being implemented later also for
+other drivers apart from libvirt.
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+
+None
+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+
+There is a pair of related Blueprints for allowing admins to force encrypted
+Live Migration thru python-novaclient and Horizon. Both user interfaces would
+make use of this functionality thru the explained changes in Nova API:
+
+*  https://blueprints.launchpad.net/horizon/+spec/encrypted-live-migration-horizon
+
+*  https://blueprints.launchpad.net/python-novaclient/+spec/encrypted-live-migration-novaclient
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+As explained here: http://libvirt.org/migration.html#transporttunnel a
+tunneled transport involves extra data copies between source and destination
+implying then a degradation in live migration performance (with the benefit of
+Security of course).
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+No specific deployment configuration would be required, but this functionality
+would initially be available only if libvirt is being used and block migration
+is not selected.
+
+Developer impact
+----------------
+
+Initially the proposal is to provide this functionality only for libvirt
+deployments; but to modify the Nova API for being ready for other
+virtualization drivers encryption implementations.
