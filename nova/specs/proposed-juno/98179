+======================================
+Add ALL-IN operator to extra spec ops
+======================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/add-all-in-list-
+operator-to-extra-spec-ops
+
+Allow extra spec to match all values in a list by adding the ALL-IN operator.
+
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+This blueprint aims to allow querying if ALL of the given values are present
+in a list.
+Currently there's support for an IN operator that returns True if a given
+element is present in a list. There is also an OR operator that
+only works for single values.
+
+Example:
+
+Suppose a flavor needs to be placed on a host that has the cpu flags 'aes'
+and 'vmx'. As it is today is not possible since the only posibility is to
+use the <in> operator. But, as the extra specs is a dict, the flavor
+extra-spec key would be the same:
+
+capabilities:cpu_info:features : <in> aes
+capabilities:cpu_info:features : <in> vmx
+
+Just one of them will be saved.
+
+something like this is needed:
+
+capabilities:cpu_info:features : <all-in> aes vmx
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+We need to add the new <all-in> operator and its lambda function to
+_op_methods dict in extra_specs_ops.py.
+
+...
+'<all-in>': lambda x, y: all(val in x for val in y),
+...
+
+Then add a call to this function with a list, instead of with a
+string if there are more than one element in the query.
+
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+Instead of add the '<all-in>' operator extend/overload the '<in>' operator to
+work with a list.
+
+capabilities:cpu_info:features : <in> aes vmx
+
+Seems to be easy to understand but could generate confusion because <in>
+operator as it is today, aims to be used to match a substring.
+
+Another possibility is add both <any> and <all> operators. By doing this, we
+are using <in> and <or> for single values and the new set of operators for
+collections values. But something is missing with this approach,
+<all> or <any> what? All elements in a list, all elements are True, or all
+elements are equal to a given value.
