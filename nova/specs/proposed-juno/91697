Subject: [PATCH] Add username in the response of nova list command

Description: Currently nova list command does not show which user the
particular VM belong too. In enterprise deployments, knowing which user
booted the VM could be very useful for the cluster administrator.
This will save admin a lot of manual steps before knowing the owner of
the VM. In this blueprint, we plan to add an additional column
'username' to 'nova list' output which will facilitate cluster
maintenance for the administrator

+Add username in nova list response
+==================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/add-username-in-nova-list-response
+
+Currently nova list command does not show which user the particular
+VM belong too. In enterprise deployments, knowing which user booted
+the VM could be very useful for the cluster administrator.
+This will save admin a lot of manual steps before knowing the owner
+of the VM. In this blueprint, we plan to add an additional column
+'username' to 'nova list' output which will facilitate cluster
+maintenance for the administrator
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+There are various scenarios in an enterprise cluster when an
+administrator needs to contact the owner/user of the VM,
+e.g. tracking down the owner of a noisy VM to ask him about
+the unexpected amount of traffic, or finding all VMs in
+SHUTOFF/ERROR state and asking the owners for permission to delete
+the VMs, etc. In the current implementation, nova list command does
+not show any information about the user that booted the VM.
+The administrator should have an easy way to get that information
+without manually looking at the database. Hence, it will be nice to
+have that in the output of 'nova list' command. In order to populate
+user information, novaclient needs to query keystone to get the user list
+each time it receives the request. Since it might be an expensive
+operation, it makes sense to keep it 'admin' only.
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+Following modifications to novaclient are expected
+
+  * When a user runs a command 'nova list --owner', novaclient creates
+    an object of keystoneclient with current auth_token and endpoint
+    as the auth_url.
+  * Using this keystoneclient object, novaclient queries users list
+    for the requested tenant from keystone and creates a users dict.
+  * While printing the response for 'nova list --owner', novaclient
+    checks whether this information is available. If it is, novaclient
+    shell displays it.
+  * If the context is non-admin, keystoneclient returns Forbidden
+    exception. Novaclient handles this exception and returns an
+    empty users dict.
+  * Seeing that users dict is empty, novaclient shell skips displaying
+    Username column.
+
+In order to achieve this, keystoneclient needs to be imported inside
+novaclient, which means a dependency on keystoneclient would be added
+in novaclient.
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+None
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+None
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+* Additional call to keystone from novaclient
+
+    keystoneclient.users.list(tenant)
+
+    GET /v2.0/users
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+
+None
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+
+None
+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+
+End user will see an additional column in the output of
+'nova list --owner' command, titled 'Username'
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+Minor performance impact will be expected from keystoneclient query.
+Everytime the admin runs this command, a new request will be sent to
+keystoneclient. This might add minor performance impact depending on
+the size of the output
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+None
+
+Developer impact
+----------------
+
+None

+
+Work Items
+----------
+
+* Import keystoneclient in novaclient
+* If --owner is present in the args, create a keystoneclient object
+  using the auth_key and the endpoint url
+* call keystoneclient.users.list
+* The call will fail if the user is non-admin. The exception will be
+  handled and empty dictionary will be returned to the caller
+* The call will succeed if the user is admin and a dictionary of
+  usernames and user-id's will be returned to the caller
+* For every user-id, novaclient will then fetch the username and display
+  it in the output
+
+Dependencies
+============
+
+* Keystoneclient would be a dependency for novaclient
+
+None
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+* The username information should be displayed in 'nova list --owner'
+  output it the user is admin
+* Make sure the username is returned only for admin role
+  and not for any other role.
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+Changes to be made to novaclient documentation to include the
+additional argument to 'nova list' command and parameter
+'username' in the response.
