+PXE Boot Instance
+=================
+
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/pxe-boot-instance
+
+
+This specification proposes a way to grant a compute instance the chance to 
+boot from network.
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+
+Currently, compute instances must be booted from images (or snapshots) 
+stored in Glance or volumes stored in Cinder. 
+
+In enterprise environments it is often desired to be able to use a Preboot 
+Execution Environment (PXE) to boot and install custom operating systems on 
+virtual machines. For this reason the aim of this specification is to give the 
+End Users the chance to select "network" as a possible booting source.
+
+It has to be underlined that the aim of this document is not to define a PXE 
+service within OpenStack: the PXE boot service should managed externally via 
+another machine within a tenant/provider network. Selecting the "network" as 
+boot device a compute instance will be created and it will broadcast a DHCP 
+request from which the PXE boot sequence will start, if a PXE Server is 
+configured to manage that request.
+
+Once PXE/Network booting is selected by the user as the instance boot 
+source, this will always be the default boot option for the instance's entire 
+lifecycle. i.e. it won't just PXE boot one-time and then revert back to 
+default.
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+Libvirt grants yet a way to trigger the boot from network of a virtual 
+machine,  specifing the Libvirt XML attribute <boot 
+dev='network'/> where required. We propose to 
+take advantage of this libvirt feature within OpenStack.
+
+A new option "--netboot" will be introduced in python-novaclient module to 
+specify the compute instance will boot from network and not from an image or 
+volume. Python-novaclient will associate to this option a fixed special 
+image token id, in this way no changes to REST API will be necessary.
+
+Nova module will recognize the special image token id, will bypass any 
+check on its existence and it will use the Libvirt Driver to generate an 
+appropriate Libvirt XML domain to boot the compute instance from network.
