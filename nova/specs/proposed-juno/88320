+================================================
+Live migrate all running instances from the host
+================================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/python-novaclient/+spec/host-servers-live-migrate
+
+The aim of this feature in python-novaclient is to allow Operators in only
+one command to live migrate all running instances from one host to other hosts.
+
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+Currently, in order to perform a maintenance operation on a host without
+service interruption for customers, Openstack Operator can live-migrate one
+by one each running instance from the host.
+
+To facilitate this operation, we propose a wrapper in python-novaclient
+that would, in only one command, live-migrate all hypervisor running instances
+to other hosts.
+
+The major difference between this new feature and two existing novaclient
+commands, namely host-evacuate [1] and host-servers-migrate [2], is that
+host-servers-live-migrate command will be transparent for customer,
+without any downtime for running instances :
+
+* ``host-evacute`` command is targeting failed compute nodes, and will
+  fail for compute nodes that are up
+
+* ``host-servers-migrate`` will **suspend** all running instances on a
+  host in order to migrate the instances on new host.
+
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+The new command will internally use the existing server live-migrate API,
+but since Nova API V3 brings some changes in the manner to query the hypervisor
+information, the proposed change will add two feature implementations in
+python-novaclient.
+
+The existing live-migration command in python-novaclient uses several
+optional arguments:
+
+* ``--block-migrate``   True in case of block_migration.
+
+* ``--disk-over-commit`` Allow disk overcommit.
+
+And positional arguments:
+
+* ``<server>``          Name or ID of server.
+
+* ``<host>``            Destination host name.
+
+Proposed new command, host-servers-live-migrate, will keep the
+same optional arguments: ``--block-migrate`` and ``--disk-over-commit``.
+The optional positional argument ``host`` will be renamed to
+``--target_host <target_host>`` and a new positional argument ``host``
+will be used in order to designate the compute node that will be taken
+out of action.
+
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+In order to avoid multiple calls from client, the alternative would be to
+implement this feature in Nova.

+
+* Implement the feature for Nova API V2
+
+* Implement the feature for Nova API V3

+
+Testing
+=======
+
+Since live-migration feature is already well covered by tempest tests, we
+think that unit tests are sufficient.
+
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+OpenStack Command-Line Interface Reference must be updated in order to
+add new command in Compute command-line client.
