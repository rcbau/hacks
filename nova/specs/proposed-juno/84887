Subject: [PATCH] Propose: Allow Nova to use either Glance V1 or V2

Nova should be configurable via a configuration parameter to use either
Glance V1 or V2 API. Due to differences in the workflow exposed by the
API, the image service layer will need to be able to present a
consistent interface to Nova while performing necessary translations to
interact with the configured Glance API version.

+=====================================
+Allow Nova to use Glance V1 or V2 API
+=====================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/use-glance-v2-api
+
+This blueprint adds support for Glance V2 API, while keeping support for the V1
+API. While this adds no extra functionality, it will allow the deprecation of
+Glance V1.
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+Due to the fact that Nova is currently using Glance V1 API, Nova cannot take
+advantages of features available in Glance V2 API: for example, to get direct
+access to the image locations regarding backend storage.
+Also, Glance is planning to deprecate V1 API: so it becomes critical to make
+Nova working with Glance V2.
+This blueprint will make Nova configurable via a configuration parameter to use
+either Glance V1 or V2 API. Due to differences in the workflow exposed by the
+API, the image service layer will need to be able to present a consistent
+interface to Nova while performing necessary translations to interact with the
+configured Glance API version.
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+This approach proposed here is to have a configuration option giving the
+ability to select if Nova uses Glance V1 or V2 API.
+This ability involves some refactoring to have glance drivers for each version
+of the API in Nova.
+If V1 is selected, then the Glance driver V1 is used (similarly for V2).
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+- Have a discovery mechanism of the version of the endpoints available:
+  the main problem with that is that the operator might want to keep using a
+  previous version of the API that is trusted and slowly move to the new
+  version of the API. Also, the behavior of features has changed in V2 and is
+  not completely compatible with current one: image properties in V2 can have
+  schema restrictions placed by the deployer but V1 ignore these restrictions.
+  Auto-negotiating could potentially result in undesired changes.
+- Have some part of Glance (client, stores) becoming a transfer service that
+  has the capability of providing to Nova what is needed to get the disk image
+  on the hypervisor and being version agnostic.
+  This would require several key architectural changes both in Glance and Nova:
+  both are not ready for that at this point.
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+From the Nova perspective, there should not be any impact on Nova's
+functionality. All the differences in the Glance API should be encapsulated
+within the Glance V1 and V2 drivers.
+All the metadata created using V1 API could also be created using V2 API.
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+None.
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+
+None.
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+
+None.
+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+
+None.
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+None.
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+A configuration section will need to be added in the configuration [glance]
+with a config parameter 'api_version' in it. Its default value is 1 meaning
+that by default Nova will be using Glance API V1. The upgrade impact should
+warn about the need for Glance V2: the deployer either needs to deploy a new
+glance-api node and enable V2 API or needs to configure Nova to use Glance V2
+API. The default version will be V1 for Juno and we plan to use V2 as default
+in the K release.
+It might be risky to expose an OpenStack cloud mixing Nova compute nodes using
+V1 and V2 Glance API at the same time: especially due to the fact that V1 and
+V2 are not fully compatible, ex: schema restrictions in V2 but not in V1.
+The existing features required to communicate with Glance will still work: the
+workflow changes will be totally transparent for the deployer.
+
+Developer impact
+----------------
+
+None.

+Work Items
+----------
+
+- Refactor the image layer to support Glance V2 support
+- Add Glance driver for V1
+- Add Glance driver for V2
+- Enable V1 and V2 driver for Nova
+- Update drivers using Glance directly (such as XenServer)
+
+Dependencies
+============
+
+None.
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+Tempest tests should be added to make sure that V2 API features are fully
+workable with Nova exercised.
+We could make one of the devstack gate job use Glance V1 and one Glance V2.
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+The new configuration variable 'api_version' in the [glance] section needs to
+be mentioned in the reference documentation. Also, the Cloud Admin Guide needs
+to be updated to let people know how to configure Nova to use one version or
+the other.
+Also, it will important to stress in the release notes, docs, etc. that the
+behavior of Glance features have changed between V1 and V2 and consequently
+are not wholly compatible: for example image properties in V2 can have schema
+restrictions placed by the deployer but V1 ignore these restrictions.
