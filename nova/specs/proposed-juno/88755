+Enable cold migration with target host
+===========================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/cold-migration-with-target
+
+The aim of this feature is to let operators cold migrate instances with
+target host manually.
+
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+I have a customized HA plugin which automatically performs migrations under
+certain conditions, and the HA plugin is able to intelligently pick up
+destinations, but only live migrations support specifying destinations.
+
+At the moment cold migration do not support migrate a VM instance with target
+host, this blueprint want to add this feature to nova so that above scenario
+can be satisified.
+
+It also make cold migration consistent with live-migrate operations as live
+migration support migration with and w/o target host.
+
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+Modify the current resize_instance flow to let the api can specify the target
+host for cold migration.
+
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+None
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+None
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+* For V2 API, a new extension will be added as:
+  alias: os-extended-admin-actions
+  name: ExtendedAdminActions
+  namespace:
+  http://docs.openstack.org/compute/ext/extended_admin_actions/api/v1.1
+
+  When the new extension "os-extended-admin-actions" is loaded, the api of
+  _migrate() wil support cold migration with target host.
+
+* For a later microversion of v2.1 API, no new extension needed, the
+  existing cold migration API will be updated to support this.
+
+* URL: existed admin actions extension as:
+       * /v2/{tenant_id}/servers/actions:
+       * /v2.1/servers/actions:
+
+  JSON request body::
+
+    {
+        "migrate":
+        {
+            "host": "fake_host"
+        }
+    }
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+None
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+None
+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+
+python-novaclient will be modified to have target_host argument as
+optional.
+
+The user can trigger this feature by:
+nova migrate my_server target_host
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+None
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+None
+
+Developer impact
+----------------
+None

+
+Work Items
+----------
+
+* Add logic to select target host for cold migration
+* Add API v2/v2.1
+* Set target host optional on nova-client
+
+Dependencies
+============
+
+None
+
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+Add unit test in nova to cover the case of cold migration with target host,
+also we probably need to think about adding functionnal tests in tempest.
+
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+* Api Docs to reflect that target host field is optional.
+* Client docs ( due to optional arg)
+* Admin User Guide on cold migration topic.
