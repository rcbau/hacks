Subject: [PATCH] Restrict live migration when consoles are open

Users shouldn't be affected due to live migration especially when
they are using consoles. If users are connected to the console then instance
migration shouldn't be allowed, instead it should return 409 error to the
administrator.

+=====================================================
+Restrict instance migration when vm consoles are open
+=====================================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/restrict-instance-migration
+
+Administrators don't want to bother users by performing live migration
+specially when they are connected to the vm console. When vm will be live
+migrated from source to the destination compute node, the vnc server running
+on the source compute node will abruptly terminate all of the opened tcp
+connections on the graphics port of the vm without intimating to the users.
+
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+When vm is live migrated to another compute node, users connected to the vm
+consoles (vnc/spice) will be terminated without prior intimation. This might
+sound annoying to the users.
+
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+We are thinking of introducing a new 'force' parameter to the live migration
+api. If force parameter is set to false, then it will check whether users are
+connected to the vm console using vnc/spice before actually performing live
+migration. If users are connected to the vm console, then it will return 409
+error to the administrator.
+Then the administrator (operations team) will inform to the owner of the vm
+that they want to perform live migration within a specified time frame and
+refrain them from connecting to the vm consoles otherwise their connections
+will be terminated automatically. This way users will be informed when the vm
+consoles will be terminated after the live migration is finished.
+
+Administrator will run live migration api with force parameter set as 'true'
+within the given time frame communicated to the user earlier. when force
+parameter is set to True, then it won't check whether users are connected to
+the vm consoles or not and straight way perform live migration.
+
+force parameter default value will be set to 'True'.
+
+Libvirt didn't expose any api to check whether the vm console is open or not.
+So in order to detect that, first we need to get all of the opened tcp
+connections on the compute node where the vm is running using command
+
+sudo netstat -nt
+
+Then using output of netstat command we can filter out all of the tcp
+connections opened for a given vm's graphics port
+<vncserver_listen:graphics port of a vm>.

+Alternatives

+
+None
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+None
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+* Live-migrate server
+
+  * Description: Live-migrates a server to a new host without rebooting
+  * Method: POST
+  * Normal response code(s): 202
+  * Expected error http response code(s): 409
+
+    * When instance migration is prformed and consoles are open
+      for given instance then 409 error will be returned to administrator.
+
+  * URL for the resource: /v2/{tenant_id}/servers/{server_id}/action
+  * Parameters which can be passed via the url
+    {tenant_id}, String, The ID for the tenant in a multi-tenancy cloud.
+    {server_id}, UUID, The UUID for the server.
+
+
+Security impact

+
+None
+
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+
+None
+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+
+None
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+One additional compute rpc call will be made if --force parameter is set
+to 'false'.
+
+Deployer impact
+---------------
+
+Added netstat command in compute.filters file
+
+Format for netstat command in compute.filters:
+
+netstat: CommandFilter, netstat, root
+
+
+Developer impact
+----------------
+
+We intend to add this check for the KVM but making provision so that other
+hypervisors can benefit too.
+A new abstract method "check_console_ports" will be added to the
+virt/driver.py
+This method will be implemented in the libvirt driver. Other hypervisors can
+implement this method based on their requirement, otherwise
+NotImplementedError will be raised with error message
+"Hypervisor driver doesn't support checking of opened consoles ports" which
+will be caught in the compute manager and no action would be taken. In short,
+force parameter will  be ignored if check_console_ports method is not
+implemented in the hypervisor.

+
+Work Items
+----------
+
+- Add a new method 'check_console_ports' in libvirt driver to check console
+  ports are opened for a given instance.
+- Add a new 'check_console_ports' compute rpc api which will be called
+  (called synchronously using call method) from the compute/api.py to check
+  users are connected to the vm console when force parameter is set to
+  'false'.
+- Add a new force parameter to live migration API.
+
+
+Dependencies
+============
+
+None
+
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+- Add tempest tests to verify the newly added force parameter is working
+  properly.
+- Add unit tests to verify the newly added force parameter is working
+  properly.
