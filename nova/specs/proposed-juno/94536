Subject: [PATCH] Add delete node to nova-manage

Add ability to permanently delete a retired compute node. The idea is
to make simple database queries, no schema changes, though that may
be necessary when this is to be implemented.

+==========================================
+Add 'delete-node' to nova-manage
+==========================================
+
+Include the URL of your launchpad blueprint:
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/add-delete-node-to-nova-manage
+
+Currently there is no way to delete a compute node from an existing
+environment - the compute node can be marked as deleted, but this doesn't
+delete anything. For the sake of sanity with regards to database content
+and also for the ease of use aspect, it would be nice to have the ability
+to not only delete a compute node from an environment, but actually have it
+deleted, not just marked as such.
+
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+There is currently no way to manually delete a compute node aside from making
+manual database changes.
+
+For an end-user, this makes it impossible to delete old decommissioned nodes.
+
+For an operator, it makes it a hassle to deal with, since it is easier to just
+type a command and have the CLI make the API call, which in turn will make
+the necessary database changes for you.
+
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+Add an API call that will allow for actual compute node deletion from a
+database - in all applicable tables.
+
+Add CLI funtionality to make this API call and verify success.
+(This will likely just be needed for python-novaclient, but adding here for
+completeness.)
+
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+I have seen no other alternatives to deleting an old node aside from making
+database changes. The goal here is to make that manual labor obsolete and
+to also allow for the permanent deletion where desired.
+
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+There should be no changes needed, since the proposition is simply allowing
+for making database queries, not schema changes.
+
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+* delete-node
+
+  * Permanently delete retired compute node.
+
+  * POST or DELETE - not sure which is more ideal here.
+
+  * /delete-node/
+
+  * Pass UUID of hypervisor
+
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+
+This should not require anything other than 'nova' database user access,
+since my proposed change only affects hypervisor information.
+
+This proposed change should also be only accessible via 'nova-manage', versus
+simply 'nova' so that it can only be run an admin.
+
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+
+None.
+
+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+
+There should be a python-novaclient call created for my proposed API addition.
+
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+None.
+
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+None.
+
+
+Developer impact
+----------------
+
+None.
+
+
+Implementation
+==============
+
+Assignee(s)
+-----------
+
+Primary assignee:
+  None
+
+Other contributors:
+  None
+
+
+Work Items
+----------
+
+* Create API call
+
+* Create call function in python-novaclient
+
+
+Dependencies
+============
+
+None.
+
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+A simple test to create a new hypervisor in the database, and then delete
+that hypervisor should be sufficient.
+
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+There will need to be a change to the related nova pages in the documentation.
+
+I can [and would]  personally take care of the doc changes.
+
+
+References
+==========
+
+None.
