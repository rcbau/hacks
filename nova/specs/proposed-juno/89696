+Config drive based on image property
+==========================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/config-drive-image-property
+
+When creating an instance, check the image property to decide if a config
+drive should be created.
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+Currently Nova decides if config drive is created for a server
+based on:
+
+a) If the user specifies the config-drive option in server create API
+   request, or,
+
+b) If the server is scheduled to a compute node with force_config_drive
+   option set.
+
+But we need consider the image requirement also. Some images may explicitly
+require config drive.
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+* Add an image property as "img_config_drive", the value of the
+  img_config_drive can be:
+
+  * img_config_drive=mandatory|optional
+
+  where these mean:
+
+  * mandatory == instance must always have a config drive
+
+  * optional == instance can use a config drive, but can still work if missing
+
+  Any other value will be treated as error. If no option specified, the default
+  value is optional.
+
+  In future, this property may be extended to include more choices like
+  'disable' to disable config_drive. A mechanism should be presented at that
+  time to make sure the 'disable' option is not treated as error.
+
+* The rule of config drive decision is described as followed table. A config
+  drive will be created whenever user specified in API, required in image
+  property or compute node configuration option specified it.
+
+    +-----------+------------------------+----------------+-----------+
+    |   API     |  Image Property        | Compute Config | Result    |
+    +===========+========================+================+===========+
+    |    No     |  Mandatory             | Set or Unset   | Yes       |
+    +-----------+------------------------+----------------+-----------+
+    |    No     |  Optional              | Set            | Yes       |
+    +-----------+------------------------+----------------+-----------+
+    |    No     |  Optional              | Unset          | No        |
+    +-----------+------------------------+----------------+-----------+
+    | Specified |  Mandatory or Optional | Set or Unset   | Yes       |
+    +-----------+------------------------+----------------+-----------+
+
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+Another option is to combine the API option and image property into one
+instance property in the API layer, but this is not clean IMHO.
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+No
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+No
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+
+No
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+
+No
+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+
+This BP will add one more image property, so user should be aware of that.
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+There will be no performance impact.
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+It's recommended that deployers update all compute nodes before they add the
+config drive property to any images. Otherwise, the image property is not
+checked by compute node w/o this features.
+
+Developer impact
+----------------
+
+No
+
+Implementation

+  yunhong-jiang
+
+Work Items
+----------
+
+* Change the virt/configdrive.py to check image property also.
+
+Dependencies
+============
+
+There are some discussion of the enhancement of image property as in
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/convert-image-meta-into-nova-object
+and the discussion is on-going.
+
+This proposal is not conflict with that proposal, we just need make sure the
+new config drive property will be defined in the VirtProperties. It will be a
+small effort no matter which proposal lands firstly.
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+Tempest tests will be added so that we can make sure the image config drive
+property is treated correctly.
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+Document change needed for the new image property.
