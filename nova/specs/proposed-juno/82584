Subject: [PATCH] Proposed blueprint for libvirt Sheepdog instances.

This blueprint would add support for using Sheepdog as a block-device
backend for libvirt instances. Looking for comments and suggestions.

+====================================================
+Support Sheepdog ephemeral disks for libvirt driver
+====================================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/libvirt-sheepdog-backed-instances
+
+Add support for Sheepdog instance ephemeral disks.
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+Sheepdog block devices can already be attached to QEMU and KVM
+virtual machines.  Nova's libvirt driver supports most of the
+functionality. The only additional changes are to the image-backend
+drivers. Both Glance and Cinder support sheepdog backends, so this
+would complement the efforts made in those projects.
+
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+This change would extend several parts of the libvirt driver. In
+general, these changes are very similar to the changes required for
+the RBD driver. These changes would bring Sheepdog support into
+feature-parity with RBD, QEMU and other libvirt image drivers.
+
+- nova.virt.libvirt.driver would be extended with cleanup functions
+  for Sheepdog, in the same way that ``cleanup_rbd_instance`` does
+  for the RBD backend.
+
+- A new ``Image`` subclass class would be added to
+  ``nova.virt.libvirt.imagebackend`` for Sheepdog.
+
+- Helper functions would be added to ``nova.virt.libvirt.utils`` where needed.
+
+- /etc/nova/rootwrap.d/filters would be extended to support rootwrap
+  on the ``dog`` command used to interact with Sheepdog.
+
+- See Deployer impact for configuration changes.
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+Cinder has existing support for Sheepdog volumes. One alternative
+is to use that driver and only launch instances from volumes. There
+are two problems with this option. First, it would not support
+instance disks that are deleted after the instance is destroyed.
+Second, for the end-user it requires additional steps to provision
+the volume before the instance is booted.
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+None.
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+None. This blueprint makes no REST API changes.
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+Rootwrap of 'dog' command on nova-compute machines.
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+None. No plans for new notifications.
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+None.
+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+
+None. This blueprint has no impact on python-novaclient or any other
+end-user interface.
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+To use this feature, a deployer must first set up a sheepdog cluster and
+then make several configuration changes to nova on machines running the
+nova-compute process. If Sheepdog is to be used with Glance and Cinder,
+the deployer must also make the appropriate configuration changes for those
+services.
+
+To setup a Sheepdog cluster, follow the install guide provided by
+Sheepdog [1]_. After setting up a Sheepdog cluster, each nova-compute
+process must be configured. The following options must be set under
+the ``[libvirt]`` section of ``nova.conf`` or ``nova-compute.conf``:
+
+- ``images_type=sheepdog`` This must be set to indicate that sheepdog should
+  be used.
+
+- ``images_sheepdog_host=locahost`` Change this if the machine running the
+  nova-compute process is not a member of the sheepdog cluster, or is not
+  acting as a gateway node within the cluster.
+
+- ``images_sheepdog_port=7000``` Change this if the sheep process is listening
+  on a different port than the default.
+
+For sites doing continuous deployment, this change will have no impact until
+the deployer changes the ``images_type`` setting to deliberately switch a
+nova-compute machine to use Sheepdog.
+
+There are no database migrations required for this change.
+
+Developer impact
+----------------
+
+This change would add an additional disk-backend to the libvirt driver,
+slightly increasing code support costs.

+Assignee(s)
+-----------
+
+Primary assignee:
+  <scott-devoid> Scott Devoid

+Other contributors:
+  <None>
+
+
+Work Items
+----------
+
+- Implement basic support for Sheepdog images booted from a Glance image.
+
+- Implement snapshot support.
+
+
+Dependencies
+============
+
+None
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+Devstack integration is required before tempest can run functional
+tests against the Sheepdog drivers for Nova, Glance and Cinder. A patch
+has been proposed which would use Sheepdog for each service. [2]
+
+This, I think, would result in many functional tests of the Sheepdog
+drivers via the Tempest tests. However, a Jenkins job would need
+to be defined and VMs would need to be provisioned to run the jobs.
+It is not clear if openstack-infra is willing or capable of committing
+to a proliferation of CI test runs. There is a Juno Summit scheduled for
+this. [3]
+
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+- Configuration reference would need to be updated with the new configuration
+  options. See the Deployer Impact section.
+
+- Cloud Administer or Operations guide should be updated with a section which
+  describes in detail how to configure Sheepdog for nova and what sort of
+  considerations should be taken into account, e.g. cluster size, Zookeeper vs
+  Corosync, the use of gateway nodes.
+
+These documentation changes would happen as part of this blueprint.
