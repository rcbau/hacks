+Support Identity v3 API
+=======================
+
+Launchpad blueprint:
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/support-keystone-v3-api
+
+The Keystone server has supported v3 of the Identity API for some time, and the
+goal is to eventually deprecate the v2 API. In order to do this Nova and other
+applications using the Identity API need to be able to be configured to use the
+v3 API rather than the v2 API.
+
+Note that there have been attempts at getting Nova to support the Identity V3
+API before, but those attempts were rejected with the reason that a
+comprehensive solution needed to be presented. As such, this document attempts
+to present a comprehensive solution. In some cases it describes work that
+doesn't need to be done, because someplace that somebody thinks might be
+affected isn't.
+
+If you're wondering about the novaclient library, that work was already done
+with https://review.openstack.org/#/c/85920/ .
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+Nova can't be configured to use the Identity v3 API. Nova doesn't use the
+Identity v3 API directly, but the Neutron client library that Nova uses does.
+
+Identity v3 authentication requires the application to specify the user and
+project's domain ID or domain name if the user or project name is given (the
+user ID and project ID are unique, but the names are only unique within a
+domain). New configuration options are required to be able to specify the
+identity API version to use and the domain for the user or project when
+authentication is done.
+
+For Neutron access, Nova uses python-neutronclient. Once python-neutronclient
+supports Identity v3 authentication (typically provided by adding support for
+keystoneclient's session), then Nova can be changed to set up the client to use
+Identity v3 authentication.
+
+If you're wondering about changes to how Nova accesses Cinder and Glance, note
+that rather than Nova getting a new token using Identity v3 API, an existing
+token is passed to the respective client. Because a token is available those
+clients don't need to use the Identity API at all to get a token and therefore
+nothing will be changed in Nova for Cinder and Glance access for this
+blueprint.
+
+If you're wondering about the auth_token middleware, yes, Nova uses it, and it
+doesn't at this point support V3 authentication. Once the auth_token middleware
+supports V3 authentication then Nova will pick that up automatically, so
+there's no work to do in Nova for auth_token support.
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+Once python-neutronclient supports using v3 for authentication, Nova will be
+changed to use it. The support is provided via neutronclient's support for
+keystoneclient's "session". When using the session, rather than passing the
+username, password, etc. to neutronclient, you instead pass a Session object.
+The Session object is initialized with the authentication plugin to use, so in
+the case of authenticating for Neutron access, Nova will use the v3 password
+plugin. Here's some docs on using sessions:
+http://docs.openstack.org/developer/python-keystoneclient/using-sessions.html
+
+In order to do v3 authentication, more information is needed. The identity API
+version to use and the user and project domains are required. These will be new
+configuration options.

+
+There will be new configuration options for Neutron access.
+
+Here are the current relevant options for Neutron authentication::
+
+  [neutron]
+
+  #admin_username=<None>
+  #admin_tenant_id=<None>
+  #admin_tenant_name=<None>
+  #admin_auth_url=http://localhost:5000/v2.0
+
+In order to use v3 auth, ``admin_auth_url`` will need to be set to a v3
+endpoint or an endpoint that can be converted to a v3 endpoint. This config
+option will support being set to an unversioned endpoint, like
+``http://localhost:5000/``. Nova will use keystoneclient's version discovery
+support to find if the identity server supports v3 or is v2 only. If the server
+reports that it supports v3 then v3 authentication will be used, otherwise Nova
+will fall back to v2 authentication. This will also support ``admin_auth_url``
+being set to a v2.0 endpoint or a v3 endpoint. The help text for
+``admin_auth_url`` will be updated.
+
+V3 authentication requires that a domain is provided for a user name or project
+name (otherwise it's not unique). So there will be new options
+``admin_user_domain_name`` and ``admin_project_domain_name``. Keystone creates
+a default domain named ``Default``, so that will be the default.
+
+The ``admin_tenant_name`` option will be renamed to ``admin_project_name`` and
+``admin_tenant_id`` to ``admin_project_id`` (the old names will still work but
+will be deprecated).
+
+
+Developer impact
+----------------
+
+None.

+Work Items
+----------
+
+* Rename ``admin_tenant_name`` option to ``admin_project_name`` and
+  ``admin_tenant_id`` to ``admin_project_id``, leaving the old option names a
+  deprecated names.
+
+* Once neutronclient supports keystoneclient's sessions
+  (`keystone-api-v3-support in Neutron`_)
+
+  * Update requirements.txt to the version of python-neutronclient that has
+    support for sessions.
+  * Change Nova to use a session for existing v2 auth for Neutron access.
+  * Change Nova to also support using v3 auth for Neutron access
+    * Add new config options for user and project domain.
+    * Use the V3 password plugin if configured for v3.
+  * Change Nova to default to v3 auth rather than v2 auth.
+  * Change Nova to also support using unversioned endpoint for Neutron access.
+  * Change Nova to default to unversioned endpoint and do discovery.
+  * Change devstack to allow configuring Nova for v2, v3, or to use discovery
+    for auth.
+  * Provide a Tempest daily configuration that sets nova to use v2 for Neutron
+    access.

+
+Dependencies
+============
+
+* python-neutronclient needs to be updated to support v3 auth. Nova will depend
+  on the version of the python-neutronclient package that has support for
+  v3. This work is in progress: keystone-api-v3-support_
+
+.. _keystone-api-v3-support: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/python-neutronclient/+spec/keystone-api-v3-support
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+Nova will support using both v3 auth and v2 auth, with v3 being the
+default. Use of v3 auth will thus be tested on every commit using the normal
+Tempest testing. We should ensure that using v2 auth still works as long as
+it's supported, and that will be done by having a nightly job that configures
+Nova for v2 auth. (We'll need a way to configure the system for this using
+devstack, so support will be added to devstack to configure Nova for v2 auth.)
+
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+There's new config options as described above.
