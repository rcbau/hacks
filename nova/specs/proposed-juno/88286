+==========================================
+Flavour CPU overcommit
+==========================================
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/flavor-cpu-overcommit
+
+The aim of this blueprint is to provide an option to schedule VMS according
+to the CPU overcommit ratio, specified in extra_specs of it's flavour.
+
+
+Problem description
+===================
+Currently there is no way to group vms according to itâ€™s cpu overcommit
+ratio. Such option is required in order to allow the users to group vms
+by its workload characteristics, cpu intensive and not, and by a flavour price
+for cpu usage.
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+Host Capabilities:
+Exposing the cpu_allocation_ratio parameter in host capabilities.
+It will make this parameter be presented to the scheduler filter.
+
+Scheduler:
+2 changes are being proposed.
+
+1.  Add a CpuOvercommitFilter filter. The filter will use
+    the alloc:cpu_ratio provided in the flavour extra_specs,
+    by the administrator, and will return a list of host that exactly match
+    the requested value or, in case such value doesn't exist, return
+    a list of host that closely match the above value.
+
+2. Modify the CpuOvercommitWeigher class, exposing the cpu_allocation_ratio
+   value as a weighting parameter, in order to have the Vms being scheduled
+   on host with the closest to the requested cpu overcommit value.
+
+Setting the overcommit ratio to 1, should effectively set the vm on
+dedicated core.
