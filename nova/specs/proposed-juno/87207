Subject: [PATCH] Propose: add a data transfer plug-in

There are two use cases for data transfer in general:
1. The machines are located in one network, e.g. one domain, one cluster,
etc. The characteristic is the machines can access each other directly via
the IP addresses(VPN is beyond consideration).
2. The machines are located in different networks, e.g. two data centers,
two firewalls, etc. The characteristic is the machines can not access each
other directly via the IP addresses(VPN is beyond consideration).

With this plug-in, data can be transferred between two machines,
no matter they are in the same network or in different networks.

+========================================================
+Add a service plug-in for data transfer among nova nodes
+========================================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/data-transfer-service-plugin
+
+
+Nova needs an abstract plug-in module to provide the data transfer service
+for the data communication between machines. There are two general use
+cases for this data transfer:
+
+1. The machines are located in one network, e.g. one domain, one cluster,
+etc. The characteristic is the machines can access each other directly via
+the IP addresses(VPN is beyond consideration).
+2. The machines are located in different networks, e.g. two data centers,
+two firewalls, etc. The characteristic is the machines can not access each
+other directly via the IP addresses(VPN is beyond consideration).
+
+
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+Nova has implemented the native functions for some hypervisors to do live
+migration, e.g. libvirt, VMware VCenter, etc. Shared storage(NFS) and
+block(iSCSI) migration have been implemented as well. To meet the need of
+migrating data(like VMs) between the machines within one network as the
+first use cases mentioned above, this is fairly enough. To transfer large data
+(e.g. 50G) from one machine to another in a different network or outside the
+firewall, in which case we are unable to establish the NFS or iSCSI
+connection, other transfer protocols, like FTP, need to be taken into account.
+
+This proposal will abstract a data transfer plug-in for the transfer protocols
+to implement. Implementations for any protocols, like NFS, iSCSI, ftp,
+bitTorrent, etc, can be put in this module for nova to use.
+
+Furthermore, FTP will be taken to transfer data between two machines in
+different networks fill up the second use case. BitTorrent, which has been
+implemented for image download in Xen, can be implemented as well for
+transferring the same data among many machines simultaneously.
+
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+* A new data transfer module is created to modulize all the transfer protocols,
+  providing some basic interfaces to implement, including creating a connection,
+  closing a connection, transferring data out, and transferring data in, etc.
+
+* Nova has already implemented an image download module and another image upload
+  module has been proposed(https://review.openstack.org/#/c/84671/). The
+  implementation for this proposal can be built based on two of these modules.
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+It is possible to implement different transfer protocols in different ways, but
+putting all of them in one module seems to be a neat way to manage them.
+
+Abstracting this module as a separate library is also a good idea, but at the
+beginning, this proposal needs another one upload plug-in to be finished first.
+This one can reuse the code of the download and upload plug-in.

+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+Different protocols may be applied for different use cases. General speaking, using
+a proper protocol for a proper use case will improve the data transfer performance.
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+The deployer will configure differently for different transfer protocols.
