Subject: [PATCH] Proposed blueprint to allow only root volume backup.

This blueprint would allow an additional parameter
'backup_only_root_volume' to be passed as part of the
create_image API call.

+==============================================================================
+Allow snapshot of only root volume during snapshot of a volume backed instance
+==============================================================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/exclude-cbs-in-snapshot
+
+This feature is to provide the user with an option to snapshot only the root
+volume during the snapshot instance action. This will not snapshot any
+other volume attached to the instance.
+This will be a feature for volume-backed instances only.
+
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+Currently, creating a snapshot of an instance which is volume-backed will
+snapshot the root volume as well as all the other volumes attached to it.
+We see issues where the snapshot process fails, while backing up a very large
+volume attached to the instance. We have cases where the snapshot process
+times out.
+
+Also, this feature would help in the case where the customer wants to snapshot
+only the root volume and none of the others.
+
+This feature would provide an option to snapshot only the root volume of the
+instance if that's the only volume that the user is concerned about, while he
+takes the snapshot. This would enhance the flexibility of the feature
+rather than always following the default behavior of taking snapshots of all
+the volumes.
+
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+In order to implement this, I propose that we allow the user to specify whether
+only the root volume needs to be backed-up during the instance snapshot
+process. This can be specified as an additional optional parameter to the
+snapshot API call.
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+None
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+None
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+API to specify whether all the volumes or only the root volume needs to be
+backed up during the snapshot process:
+
+Workflow:
+* If the option 'snapshot_only_root_volume' is specified as 'true', snapshot
+only the root volume of the instance.
+* If the option 'snapshot_only_root_volume' is specified as 'false', or not
+specified at all, snapshot all the volumes. (Default behavior)
+
+v3 API specification:
+POST: /v3/servers/{server_id}/action
+
+Request attribute to be added:
+* snapshot_only_root_volume: true/false value to specify whether only the root
+volume needs to be backed up. (Optional)
+
+Example JSON request::
+
+    {
+        "createImage" : {
+            "name" : "new-image",
+            "metadata": {
+                "ImageType": "Gold",
+                "ImageVersion": "2.0"
+            }
+            "snapshot_only_root_volume": true,
+        }
+    }
+
+Response codes:
+HTTP 202 on success
+HTTPBadRequest exception if "snapshot_only_root_volume" is not a valid boolean
+value.
+
+Sample v3 request:
+POST: /v3/servers/7d14f8123/action -d '{"create_image":
+{"name": "image-name", "snapshot_only_root_volume": "true"}
+
+This would snapshot only the root volume of the instance, provided the instance
+is volume backed.
+
+Validation:
+'snapshot_only_root_volume' must be a boolean value, true/false.
+(Optional parameter)
+
+Not implementing the feature in v2, as the idea is to keep v2 changes minimal.
+
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+
+None
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+
+None
+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+
+The create_image call in python-novaclient will have to include the additional
+optional parameter
+
+Optional argument:
+--snapshot_only_root_volume True or false value to specify whether only the root
+volume is to be backed up.
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+None
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+None
+
+Developer impact
+----------------
+
+The parameter will be optional, so no other code needs to be changed.

+
+Work Items
+----------
+
+* Changes to be made to the compute manager 'snapshot_volume_backed' method to
+  use the 'snapshot_only_root_volume' parameter passed in, to decide whether
+  all or only the root volume needs to be backed up.
+* Changes to the V3 API to take in the optional parameter
+  'snapshot_only_root_volume'.
+* Include tests in tempest to check the behavior of create_image of the
+  instance with snapshot only root volume option set.
+
+
+Dependencies
+============
+
+None
+
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+Tempest tests to be added to check if only the root volume is backed up when
+the parameter 'snapshot_only_root_volume' is set to true in the API call.
+
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+Changes to be made to the create_image API documentation to include the
+additional parameter 'snapshot_only_root_volume' that can be passed in, and its
+usage information.
