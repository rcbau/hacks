Subject: [PATCH] Add CPU CQM (Cache Qos Monitoring) management

Intel's new CPUs introduce Cache QoS Monitoring (CQM) allows an Operating System,
Hypervisor or similar system management agent to determine the usage of cache
by applications running on the platform. The initial implementation is directed
at last level cache (LLC) monitoring. So this can be used to monitor the
instance's cache.

Add the RMID resouce plugin to manager which instance can be monitored
the cache.

+ Add CPU CQM (Cache Qos Monitoring) management
+==============================================
+
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/cache-qos-monitoring
+
+CQM:Enables monitoring of cache occupancy on a per-thread (via RMID) basis.
+
+RMID : The ID of the application or thread on a core as specified by the
+OS/VMM. This ID is provided by the OS/VMM, and used by the platform to tag
+and monitor events such as cache occupancy.
+
+Intel's new CPUs introduce Cache QoS Monitoring (CQM) allows an Operating
+System, Hypervisor or similar system management agent to determine the usage
+of cache by applications running on the platform. The initial implementation
+is directed at last level cache (LLC) monitoring.
+
+We want to add this new feature into OpenStack in this blueprint. And this
+need kernel and xen to support the CQM feature. So We will do some work in
+kernel, xen, libvirt, xenapi and OpenStack.
+
+When get one instance's' cache data, should via a RMID, but the total RMID
+numbers of different platforms are differents. So we want to add a RMID
+managerment in Nova.
+
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+The main use case is to monitor the cache of each intstance. The user can
+enable the CQM function in the Nova and get the instance's 'cache data from
+Ceilometer agent[3].
+#TBD
+
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+This blueprint dependencies on Paul Murray's blueprint[1].
+Add a RMID resource plugin to manager the RMID resource. The RMID plugin record
+how many RMIDs are used and the total RMID numbers of host.
+
+The deployer should add a key ("resource:cpu_cqm":True ) to extra_specs to mark
+if the instance need to use the CQM monitor, the RMID plugin will put the key to
+instance_system_metadata, when libvirt/xenapi creates the instance, it will start
+the instance's cache monitoring. if the instance is created successfully, the
+plugin will record one RMID was used.
+
+Also need a RMID filter to check if the host has RMID to the new instance, if
+not, will return 0.
+
+#TBD (more details about the libvirt module)

+None
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+The blueprint used the extra_resources field in the compute node table to
+communicate the resource tracking information. This field was added to the
+database in Icehouse-2 but has not yet been used.
+The extra_specs field will be added to the instances table in
+Paul Murray's blueprint[1].

+Dependencies
+============
+
+*This blueprint dependency on extensible-resource-tracking

+*Also dependecy on the new version of kernel, xen, libvirt and xenapi.
