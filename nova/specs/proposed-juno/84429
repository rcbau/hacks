+===========================================
+API: Evacuate instance to a scheduled host
+===========================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/find-host-and-evacuate-instance
+
+The aim of this feature is to let operators evacuate instances without
+selecting a target host manually. The scheduler will select the best
+target instead.
+
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+In the event of a unrecoverable hardware failure (compute-node down),
+Operators need to evacuate the instances by selecting a target
+compute host.
+
+This may work for temporary pre-selected failover-hosts, but if they
+just want to evacuate/rebuild the instance without taking further
+action, Operators must check each instance/flavor metadata and select
+target hosts that match the specs individually for each evacuation.
+
+In case of using external tools to trigger the evacuation, logic about
+the compute-hosts has to be there to appropriately call the API.
+
+It also make it consistent with migrate and live-migrate operations.
+
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+Modify the current rebuild_instance flow to let the scheduler pick up the best
+target host for the instance being evacuate.
+
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+Something external to pick up the proper host when
+nova can already do it.
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+None
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+The current evacuate API v2/v3 will be modified to accept body data without
+target host field and this change will be advertised through a new
+extension ExtendedEvacuateFindHost in case of v2.
+If the field is present but empty old behavior will be applied to be
+able to determine if it's an missing due to input error or not.
+
+* Evacuate an instance to another compute-host.
+     * POST
+     * Normal Response Code: 200
+     * Expected error http response code(s)
+           - 404: Compute host (if provided)/instance not found
+           - 400: Compute service in use
+           - 409: Invalid instance state
+     * v2|v3/servers/id/action
+     * Schema definition for V3::
+
+        evacuate = {
+        'type': 'object',
+        'properties': {
+            'evacuate': {
+                'type': 'object',
+                'properties': {
+                    'on_shared_storage': parameter_types.boolean,
+                    'admin_password': parameter_types.admin_password,
+                },
+                'required': ['on_shared_storage']
+                'additionalProperties': False,
+            },
+        },
+        'required': ['evacuate'],
+        'additionalProperties': False,
+        }
+
+     * Sample request::
+
+        { "evacuate": { "adminPass": "%(adminPass)s",
+                        "onSharedStorage": "%(onSharedStorage)s" }}
+
+     * Sample Response::
+
+        {  "adminPass": "%(password)s" }}

+Security impact
+---------------
+None
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+None
+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+
+python-novaclient will be modified to have target_host argument as
+optional.
+
+The user can trigger this feature by:
+nova evacuate my_server
+
+
+Performance Impact

+
+Work Items
+----------
+
+* Move rebuild instance to conductor task to unify rebuild/evacuate logic
+* Add logic to select target host
+* Add APIv2/v3
+* Set target-host optional on nova-client
+* Allow evacuating instances in an 'affinity' group, allowing the scheduler to
+  pick the destination
+
+Dependencies
+============
+
+For a complete use-case the following bp will be required
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/validate-targethost-live-migration,
+since we can retrieve the original scheduler hints from that a particular
+instance and let the  scheduler select the best host based on that.
+Until then, instances launched without any scheduler hint could still be
+selected by the scheduler by using flavor specs.
+
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+Tempest do not currently support multi-node tests, so it will be added
+after CI can run those kind of tests.
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+* Api Docs to reflect that host field is now optional. If not present
+  in the body the new feature will be triggered.
+* Client docs ( due to optional arg)
+* Admin User Guide on evacuation topic.
