+Refactor network API
+======================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/refactor-network-api
+
+To have a common API network base with all required methods so
+neutron / nova network api can inherit from.
+
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+Right now network api's do not inherit from a common base, and if the
+functionality is not implemented developers may forget to add the
+method.
+The situation is that every time that functionality want to be accessed
+from the API an exception is thrown due to missing methods and not clear
+error is returned.
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+The idea is to create a network_base API that define all the possible
+methods and just throw NotImplementedError, so next time the user will
+see the proper error message.
+
+Also fields like sentinel object could be directly inherited in the base
+api.
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+The current way to do this is to manually add the missing methods to
+neutronv2 api for instance. Every time someone add a new method to one
+api has to do the same for the others and raise NotImplementedError if
+not supported.

+----------------

+If developers add new methods to neutronv2 or nova-network api,
+they must define it first on the new network base api.
