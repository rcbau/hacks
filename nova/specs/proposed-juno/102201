+nested-quota-driver-api
+=======================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/nested-quota-driver-api
+
+Nested quota driver will enable  OpenStack projects to enforce quota
+in nested projects.The current openstack nova implementation can support
+only one level of hierarchy,ie projects and users.The nested projects
+are having a hierarchical structure, where each project contains projects
+and users inside it ,except those at the leaf nodes,which contain only
+users.
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+Use Case 1 :
+
+Consider the use case of a special effects company named Industrial Light
+And Magic(ILM). The parent project ILM ,will be having different projects
+like ANIMATION,ACTION and FICTION,to deal with different types of films.
+So,under FICTION there will be projects like MATRIX,AVATAR etc ,under
+ACTION there will be MI,SKYFALL etc,and ANIMATION will be having projects
+like SHREK,TINTIN etc.
+
+Consider the hierarchy ILM->FICTION->MATRIX.Suppose, George is having
+manager role in ILM,John is having manager role in FICTION and Peter is
+having manager role in MATRIX.Through role inheritance,George and John
+will be having the same role in their child projects.
+
+Suppose the free instance cores in ILM and FICTION are 500 and 100,
+respectively.And MATRIX, which has a total allocation of 50 cores,needs
+an additional 150 cores.If the user is George ,FICTION will take 50 cores
+from ILM ,and a total of 150 cores will be given to MATRIX.But John
+cannot provide 150 cores to MATRIX, as he doesn't have any role in ILM,
+and FICTION is having only 100 free cores with it.
+
+Suppose after some time, MATRIX doesn't require 75 cores and it needs to
+be allocated back to the parent project.If John is doing the deletion,
+the 75 cores will add to the free quota of FICTION and if George is doing
+the deletion,75 cores will add to the free quota of ILM.For efficient
+utilization of resources,it is ensured that more free quota is available
+at the higher levels,so that maximum number of projects can make use of it.
+It can be configured whether the free quota should go to the immediate
+parent or the topmost parent where the user is having the same role.
+
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+
+The total quota of a project falls in four categories,
+1.Used Quota.
+2.Reserved Quota
+3.Allocated Quota
+4.Free Quota
+Note:Allocated quota is the quota which is allocated to child projects.
+
+Project Creation:
+While creating the project,it will be having either the default quota
+or the free quota of the parent,whichever is smaller.
+
+Project Deletion:
+A project can be deleted if it doesn't have any allocation in the child
+project.The quota of the deleted project ,will add to the free quota of
+the topmost project where the user is having the same role,  or to the
+immediate parent project,which is configurable.
+
+Quota Expansion:
+While quota expansion,upper limit is determined by the free quota available
+with the parent project.If the requirement of the child  crosses the free
+quota of the parent,free quota of the parent is raised by taking free quota
+from the project, which is the parent of the parent project,and the process
+continues till the requirement is met.
+
+Quota Deletion:
+Quota deletion is equaivalent to upating the quota to a smaller value.The
+lower limit of quota is the sum of  used,reserved and allocated quotas.
+
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+None
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+One column named "allocated" needs to be added to the quota_usages table.
+It denotes the quota which is allocated to the child projects.
+
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+There will be no change in the API calls.For example ,consider the command,
+PUT /v2/{tenant_id3}/os-quota-set/{tenant_id3}
+-d '{"quota_set":{"ram": 2048}}'.
+The keystone will give the hierarchy from bottom to the top,like
+tenant_id3.tenant_id2.tenant_id1.If sufficient amount of ram is not
+available with tenant_id2,then free quota of tenant_id2 will be raised by
+allocating quota from tenant_id1.
+
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+
+None
+
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+
+During quota expansion,if the sufficient amount of quota is not found,even
+after traversing till the topmost project,where the user is having the same
+role, "Quota Insufficient" message will be given.During quota deletion,if
+the quota goes below the sum of "in_use","reserved" and "allocated" quotas,
+then "Operation Not Permitted" message will be given.
+
+
+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+
+None
+
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+If the sufficient free quota is not available with the immediate parent,
+it has to be taken from the projects further up in the order ,which
+requires more database operations
+
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+None
+
+
+Developer impact
+----------------
+
+None

+
+Work Items
+----------
+
+1.The current dbquotadriver should be extended for nested projects
+
+2.When the immediate parent is not having sufficient quota for the child,
+there should be an iterative mechanism to go up the hierarchy till
+sufficient quota is found and allocated.
+
+3.While deletion of  projects,the free quota should add to the
+topmost parent project,where the user who is deleting is having the same
+rule or it should go to the immediate parent.The choice of action can
+be configured.
+
+4.While reducing the quota,lower limit should be considered.
+
+
+Dependencies
+============
+
+Depends on keystone to  get the hierarchy of projects,and the users
+and their corresponding roles in those projects
+
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+Integration and unit tests should be added.It should be verified that ,
+whether the quota is properly allocated from the parent,and if sufficient
+quota is not available with the immediate parent,it is taken from higher
+levels.Also,it should be verfied that ,when there is a deletion of quota or
+project,the free quota is getting added to the topmost project,where the
+user is having the same role.

+Documentation Impact
