+=====================================
+Add Support for DB2 (v10.5+)
+=====================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/db2-database
+
+The community currently supports MySQL and PostgreSQL production databases.
+Several other core projects already support DB2 (Keystone, Glance, Neutron,
+Ceilometer, Heat). This blueprint adds support to Nova for DB2 as a production
+database.
+
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+* Currently there is no support in the community for a deployer to run Nova
+  against a DB2 backend database.
+
+* For anyone running applications against an existing DB2 database that wants
+  to move to OpenStack, they'd have to use a different database engine to
+  run Nova in OpenStack.
+
+* There is currently an inconsistent support matrix across the core projects
+  since the majority of core projects support DB2 but Nova does not yet.
+
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+Add code to support migrating the Nova database against a DB2 backend. This
+would require a fresh deployment of Nova since there are no plans to migrate
+an existing Nova database from another engine, e.g. MySQL, to DB2.
+
+Unit test code would also be updated to support running tests against a DB2
+backend with the ibm_db_sa driver and all Nova patches will be tested against a
+Tempest full run with 3rd party CI running DB2 that IBM will maintain.
+
+There is already some code in Oslo's db.api layer to support common function
+with DB2 like duplicate entry error handling and connection trace, so that is
+not part of this spec.
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+Deployers can use other supported database backends like MySQL or PostgreSQL,
+but this may not be an ideal option for customers already running applications
+with DB2 that want to integrate with OpenStack. In addition, you could run
+other core projects with multiple schemas in a single DB2 OpenStack database,
+but you'd have to run Nova separately which is a maintenance/configuration
+problem.
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+#. The 216 migration will be updated to handle conditions with DB2 like index
+   and foreign key creation. The main issue here is that DB2 does not support
+   unique constraints over nullable columns, it will instead create a unique
+   index that excludes null keys. Most unique constraints created in Nova are
+   on non-nullable columns, but the instances.uuid column is nullable and the
+   216 migration creates a unique index on it, but this will not allow any
+   foreign keys on the instances.uuid column to be created with DB2 since the
+   reference column has to be a unique or primary key constraint.
+#. In order to support creating the same foreign keys that reference the
+   instances.uuid column as other database engines, the instances.uuid column
+   must be made non-nullable and a unique constraint must be created on it.
+   The dependent blueprint "Enforce unique instance uuid in data model" is
+   used to handle this change.
+#. Finally, add another migration script which creates the previously excluded
+   foreign keys from the 216 migration script for DB2.
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+None.
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+
+None.
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+
+None.
+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+
+None.
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+The only performance impact on existing deployments is in the migration
+script changes which would be tested with turbo-hipster.
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+The new database migration which creates the missing foreign keys since the
+control node needs to be down when running the migration. However, the new
+migration only creates foreign keys if the backend is DB2, which would be a new
+installation as noted in the "Proposed change" section so the impact should be
+minimal.
+
+Developer impact
+----------------
+
+The only impact on developers is if they are adding DB API code or migrations
+that do not work with DB2 they will have to adjust those appropriately, just
+like we do today with MySQL and PostgreSQL. IBM active technical contributors
+would provide support/guidance on issues like this which require specific
+conditions for DB2, although for the most part the DB2 InfoCenter provides
+adequate detail on how to work with the engine and provides details on error
+codes.

+Work Items
+----------
+
+#. Change the 216 migration to work with DB2.
+#. Add a new migration to create the excluded foreign keys from the 216 script
+   for DB2.
+#. Make the test_migrations.py module work with a configured DB2 backend for
+   running unit tests.
+
+See the WIP patch for details: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/69047/

+
+Dependencies
+============
+
+* Blueprint "Enforce unique instance uuid in data model":
+  https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/enforce-unique-instance-uuid-in-db
+
+* DB2 10.5 support was added to sqlalchemy-migrate 0.9 during Icehouse:
+  https://blueprints.launchpad.net/sqlalchemy-migrate/+spec/add-db2-support
+
+* There are no requirements changes in Nova for the unit tests to work. The
+  runtime requirements are the ibm-db-sa and ibm_db modules, which are both
+  available from pypi. sqlalchemy-migrate optionally imports ibm-db-sa. The
+  ibm-db-sa module requires a natively compiled ibm_db which has the c binding
+  that talks to the DB2 ODBC/CLI driver.
+
+* Note that only DB2 10.5+ is supported since that's what added unique index
+  support over nullable columns which is how sqlalchemy-migrate handles unique
+  constraints over nullable columns.
+
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+There are three types of testing requirements, Tempest, unit test and
+turbo-hipster performance/scale tests. Each have different timelines for when
+they are proposed to be implemented.
+
+* IBM is already running 3rd party CI for DB2 on the existing Nova WIP patch
+  that adds DB2 support. The same 3rd party CI is running against all
+  sqlalchemy-migrate changes with DB2 on py26/py27 and runs Tempest against
+  Keystone/Glance/Cinder/Heat patches with a DB2 backend. Once the DB2 support
+  is merged the DB2 3rd party CI would run against all Nova patches with a full
+  Tempest run. This is considered required testing for this blueprint to merge
+  in the Juno release.
+
+* While code will be added to make the Nova unit tests work against a DB2
+  backend, running Nova unit tests against DB2 with third party CI is not
+  considered in the scope of this blueprint for Juno, but long-term this is
+  something IBM wants to get running for additional QA coverage for DB2 in
+  Nova. This is something that would be worked on after getting Tempest
+  running. The plan for delivering third party unit test coverage is in the
+  K release.
+
+* Running 3rd party turbo-hipster CI against DB2 is not in plan for this
+  blueprint in Juno but like running unit tests against DB2 in 3rd party CI,
+  running turbo-hipster against DB2 in 3rd party CI would be a long-term goal
+  for QA and the IBM team will work on that after Tempest is running and after
+  unit test CI is worked on. The plan for delivering third party turbo-hipster
+  performance test coverage is in the K release.
+
+* The proposed penalty for failing to deliver third party unit test and/or
+  turbo-hipster performance test coverage in the K release is that the Nova
+  team will turn off voting/reporting of DB2 third party CI and not allow DB2
+  fixes to Nova until the third party CI is available.

+
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+* The install guides in the community do not go into specifics about setting up
+  the database.  The RHEL/Fedora install guide says to use the openstack-db
+  script provided by openstack-utils in RDO which uses MySQL.  The other
+  install guides just say that SQLite3, MySQL and PostgreSQL are widely used
+  databases. So for the install guides, those generic statements about
+  supported databases would be updated to add DB2 to the list. Similar generic
+  statements are also made in the following places which would be updated as
+  well:
+
+   * http://docs.openstack.org/training-guides/content/developer-getting-started.html
+   * http://docs.openstack.org/admin-guide-cloud/content/compute-service.html
+   * http://docs.openstack.org/trunk/openstack-ops/content/cloud_controller_design.html
+
+* There are database topics in the security guide, chapters 32-34, so there
+  would be DB2 considerations there as well, specifically:
+
+   * http://docs.openstack.org/security-guide/content/ch041_database-backend-considerations.html
+   * http://docs.openstack.org/security-guide/content/ch042_database-overview.html
+   * http://docs.openstack.org/security-guide/content/ch043_database-transport-security.html
