+Audit compute node for controller node recovery
+===============================================
+
+Launchpad blueprint:
+
+Not created
+
+This blueprint proposes an mechanism to audit compute node, which could be used
+during a controller node is recovered from crash and make the information in
+database sync with the status in compute node ASAP,therefore bring the controller
+node back in service with minimum services disturbance.
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+A controller node is the central part of OpenStack. It normally serves a lot of
+services that keep OpenStack running, e.g. database, message queue, keystone,
+nova-scheduler, nova-conductor, neutron server, dashboard, etc. In OpenStack, HA
+services are supported on controller node in order to improve system availability,
+but there is no clear solution on how to recover from crash in case of a disaster
+happens. This could not fill the requirement on a critical system that well.
+Because: 
+As End User, it is important to have OpenStack and guest services with minimum
+interruption when OpenStack is recovered from crash or backup. 
+
+As Deployer, it should be possible to backup and recover OpenStack system.
+
+To make these possible, audit compute node against controller node database is a
+basic requirement.
+
+The similar idea could go with network and storage as well. However, this
+blueprint will only focus on compute service.
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+The proposal is described in the diagram below from the high level
+
+.. image:: https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/File:Audit-compute-node-on-controller-recovery.png 
+         :width: 768 px
+         :height: 640 px
+         :align: center
+         :scale: 100%
+
+As described in the diagram: 
+
+* 1 When nova-conductor is created, it associates to message queue. 
+* 2-5 Right after that, it issue an audit request to all active compute nodes.
+* 6-7 compute node reports the instances status back to into database through
+  nova-conductor. It will flag set timestamp of audit activity in database as well.
+* 8-10 compute node reports the current compute resource to database through nova
+  conductor. After update compute resource, it will always check if an audit
+  procedure is needed by checking audit timestamp.
+* 11-14 This is the same as 3-7
+
+Instances and compute resource are the items to be audited.
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+None
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+
+In the ComputeNode table, there will a new column named last_audit to store a
+timestamp. This should be updated in nova/db/sqlalchemy/models.py:class ComputeNode
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+None
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+None
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+
+A new notifications that notify Deployer the outcome of the audit. 
+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+None
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+Might slow system startup
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+None
+
+Developer impact
