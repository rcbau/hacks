+Hyper-V RemoteFX support
+==========================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/hyper-v-remotefx
+
+This blueprint introduces RemoteFX support in the Nova Hyper-V driver.
+
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+OpenStack VDI support on Hyper-V can greatly benefit from enabling RemoteFX
+in the Nova driver.
+
+RemoteFX allows a guest VM to access the hypervisor's GPU features for 3D
+graphical acceleration.
+
+Guest configuration is performed by specifying the number of virtual desktops
+to be used by the VM and the maximum resolution, with a given set of predefined
+values:
+
+"1024x768"
+"1280x1024"
+"1600x1200"
+"1920x1200"
+"2560x1600"
+
+The hypervisor available resources include the total video memory provided by
+the combined video adapters configured for RemoteFX.
+
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+The RemoteFX resources are provided by the hypervisor and need to be handled
+in a way similar to other compute resources. In particular:
+
+* The Nova Hyper-V driver needs to report the amount of available RemoteFX
+  video memory as part of the host capabilities
+* The Nova Hyper-V driver needs to evaluate video memory requirements specified
+  in the flavor extra specs when spawning images
+* The Nova scheduler needs a filter to allocate instances based on video memory
+  flavor requirements. The filter needs also to be taken into account for live
+  migration / cold migration / resize operations.
+
+Example flavor with RemoteFx support:
+
+    nova flavor-key remotefx1 set "hyperv:remotefx=1280x1024,2"
+
+The amount of video memory consumed by an instance based on a given resolution
+and monitor count can be calculated as:
+
+video_memory = 64*horizontal_res*vertical_res*monitor_count
+e.g.: 64*1280*1024*2 = 167772160 bytes
+
+During the configuration of Hyper-V instances, RemoteFX resources can be
+assigned by using the Msvm_Synthetic3DDisplayControllerSettingData WMI class.
+
+On each compute host, the "Remote Desktop Services Virtualization Host" (RDVH)
+role must be enabled on the host and one or more physical GPUs with RemoteFX
+support need to be available.
+
+RDVH can be enabled with:
+
+    Add-WindowsFeature â€“Name RDS-Virtualization
