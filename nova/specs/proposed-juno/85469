+========================================================
+Integrate the vmware driver with the oslo.vmware library
+========================================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/use-oslo-vmware
+
+Now that the oslo.vmware library has been released, the vmware driver should be
+updated to use it.
+
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+Too much code duplication of vmware-related projects led to the creation of the
+oslo.vmware project (https://github.com/openstack/oslo.vmware). Now that it is
+released, and already started to be used by Glance and Ceilometer, it's time
+the nova driver does the same.
+
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+This means mostly adding new import lines, mechanical conversion of call sites
+and deleting existing code obsoleted by the library.  Most of the work has
+already be done and proposed in the icehouse cycle
+(https://review.openstack.org/#/c/70175/) so that can be used as the starting
+point of the patch.
+The changes are pure code reorganization, and has no externally visible impact.
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+None, unless we consider the undesirable option of keeping status quo as one.
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+None
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+None
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+
+None
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+
+None
+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+
+None
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+None
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+Some version of the oslo.vmware library as eventually dictated by the
+the project requirements will have to be installed for the updated vmware
+driver to function.
+
+Developer impact
+----------------
+
+While the changes are mechanical, it touches many places in the vmwareapi
+driver code base, so it can cause a lot of conflict with other driver work.
+Once merged, it is likely all vmware driver related patches under review will
+have to be updated to account for it.
+
+On the flip side, there is developer impact of this change not being merged as
+well:
+
+Until this change is merged, driver changes/fixes to areas of functionality
+that oslo.vmware also provides means that a developer should almost always have
+to update both nova and oslo.vmware with similar patches.
+
+To migitate this issue of conflicts and code duplication, it is recommended
+that patches related to the vmware driver should be made dependent on this
+work.
+
+Changes to the nova driver may now require a change/release to oslo.vmware
+as a pre-requisite.

+
+Work Items
+----------
+
+Mostly https://review.openstack.org/#/c/70175/ plus some additional updates to
+account for recent code additions to the vmware driver code.
+
+
+Dependencies
+============
+
+Changes pertaining to
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/vmware-spawn-refactor
+will cause significant code churn, but given the mostly mechanical nature of
+the changes to this blueprint, reacting to the former should be fairly
+straightforward.
+
+Given that this work and that for the vmware-spawn-refactor blueprint are
+fairly orthogonal, and both necessary to facilitate additional changes to the
+driver, it is proposed that they be considered the highest-priority items for
+the vmware driver to be included in Juno-1.
+
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+Unit tests exercising the obsoleted code will be removed. Updating existing
+tests that currently mocks the obsoleted code to use use.vmware accordingly
+so that they pass should be sufficient to validate the change.
+
+No externally visible changes means no additional Tempest tests are needed.
+
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+None
