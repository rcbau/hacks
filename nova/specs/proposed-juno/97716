+====================================================================
+Support multiple interfaces from one VM attached to the same network
+====================================================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/multiple-if-1-net
+
+Permit VMs to attach multiple interfaces to one network to facilitate use
+of common NFV network function VMs that require this form of attachment.
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+At present, Nova only permits a single VIF from each VM to be attached
+to a given Neutron network.  If you attempt to attach multiple VIFs to
+the same network, an error is issued, meaning that the second network
+is not found from the list of networks remaining after the first
+network is not used.
+
+NFV functions occasionally require multiple interfaces to be attached
+to a single network from the same VM, for reasons described below in
+the 'use cases' section.  When this is required, the VNF generally
+cannot be used under Openstack.
+
+VNFs are often large, complex pieces of code, and may be supplied by third
+parties.  For various reasons, it is not uncommon that it is necessary to
+feed traffic out of an interface and into another interface (when the VNF
+implements multiple functions and the functions cannot be chained internally)
+or to feed traffic from e.g. the internet into multiple interfaces to run
+them through separate processing functions internally.
+
+The limitation can be seen as one of the VNF.  Clearly, the VNF could be
+changed to put multiple addresses or functions on a single port (to fix the
+incoming traffic issue) or to connect functions internally (to fix the
+passthrough problem.
+
+The problem with this solution is that the timescale for getting such a fix
+is often prohibitive.  VNFs are large, complex pieces of code, and often the
+supplier of the VNF is not the same organisation as that trying to use
+the VNF within Openstack, necessitating a feature change request which may
+well not be possible within reasonable timescales.
+
+We propose changing the code within Nova to remove this limitation.
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+We propose removing the limitation, which exists in Nova (Neutron has no such
+limitation), allowing any number of VIFs to be attached to the same network.
+
+The ordering in the nova 'boot' command or POST should be respected, so if
+multiple interfaces are in use on the same network they are attached to the VM
+in the order in which they are provided, as with other NICs.
+
+API changes
+-----------
+
+When the attempt is made to attach multiple interfaces to a single
+network, Nova will, instead of returning the error, attach multiple
+interfaces to the same network and return a normal success code to the
+'nova boot' attempt.
+
+('nova interface-attach' already permits a second attachment to the same
+network and needs no change.)
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+It may be possible to work around this limitation by using multiple
+ports on the same network and attach the VM to the ports, rather than
+the same network twice.  This has not been tested.  On the other hand,
+this indicates that the limitation is highly artificial and should, in
+any case, be removed.  (In any case we should confirm this is possible
+after the change and fix it if not.)
+
+It is possible to boot the VM and use 'nova interface-attach' to get
+multiple interfaces on the same network, but this requires the VM to support
+PCI hotplug.
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+None.
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+When the attempt is made to attach multiple interfaces to a single
+network, Nova will, instead of returning the error, attach all
+interfaces to the same network and return a normal success code to the
+'nova boot' attempt.
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+
+It is now going to be possible to bridge multiple interfaces together
+within a VM and cause a broadcast storm.  It was always possible to
+flood a Neutron network from a VM; this makes it easier.  It doesn't
+make a security issue in and of itself but it certainly does make it a
+little more straightforward to trigger one that arguably already
+exists.
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+
+None.
+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+
+None.  An end user using API calls that currently succeed will see no change
+in behaviour in those APIs.  This only changes a case where an API currently
+fails.
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+None.
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+None.
+
+Developer impact
+----------------
+
+None.

+
+Work Items
+----------
+
+* Change the Nova code, per the existing abandoned patch in
+  https://review.openstack.org/#/c/26370 - which requires porting
+  forward from the code in question to the current trunk.
+
+* Add unit tests, which are missing from the abandoned patch.
+
+Dependencies
+============
+
+None.
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+Independently of this spec, tests should be added to Tempest:
+
+* minimally, to ensure that traffic can be passed between the two
+  interfaces on a VM created in this fashion
+
+* optionally, traffic flow should be tested from another VM or
+  external packet supplier to either of the interfaces.
+
+Testing should be conducted with both the nova boot and nova
+interface-attach methods.
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+The change should be documented. No documentation exists for the
+current behaviour.  Documentation exists for nova-network multinic
+saying that VIFs are attached to separate networks but this is specific
+to nova-network.
