Subject: [PATCH] VMware: Store vCenter passwords in keystone credential store

This blueprint proposes an alternative way of storing vCenter user names and
passwords for OpenStack administrators that are leery of keeping them within
nova.conf as plain text.

+VMware: avoid vCenter plain text passwords in nova.conf
+=======================================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/vmware-encrypt-vcenter-passwords
+
+This blueprint proposes an alternative way of storing vCenter user names and 
+passwords for OpenStack administrators that are leery of keeping them within
+nova.conf as plain text.
+
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+One of the primary concerns to customers using OpenStack is the use of plain
+text passwords in conf files. This blueprint's goal is scoped only to the
+concern of the VMware vCenter/ESX passwords found in nova.conf. When using the
+vCenter driver, a usernames and passwords are stored in plain text inside the
+nova.conf file in order to establish a connection to the remote hypervisor.
+
+The goal is to protect access to such passwords. This can be done in a number
+of ways, but the below solution outlines a technique using existing OpenStack
+infrastructure. 
+
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+The proposed solution is to give a user the capability to put the vCenter user
+and password in the keystone credential store instead of nova.conf. As of
+version 3, keystone includes a credential store.  The credential store database
+access is secured through use of the nova user and password.
+
+The vmware driver would first check the 'vmware' section of the nova.conf for
+the host_ip, host_username, and host_password. Only in the case where
+host_username and/or host_password are not found in nova.conf, does the driver
+contact keystone to search for an appropriate credential.
+
+The credential store in keystone does not have a strict schema. The most common
+type of credential used there is 'ec2'. This blueprint introduces a new type of
+string 'vmware'. The credential blob is encoded with three fields host_ip,
+host_username, and host_password, matching those found in nova.conf. The
+host_ip is required in order to match the specific host being used by this
+nova compute instance.
+
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+One alternative to this blueprint is to encrypt the password string contained
+within nova.conf.  When reviewing this proposal with others within the
+community, the consensus was that this was no more secure than plain text.
+That's because any user who is able to get access to the nova.conf, also would
+have the ability to brute force decrypt the password stored within it.
+
+Another alternative suggested is to use Cloudkeep (a.k.a Barbican).  Cloudkeep
+would be a more general solution that could apply to any private credential
+storage.  But the drawback to a customer might be the introduction of another
+service that needs to be maintained.
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+None
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+None
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+
+This solution does not introduce a security impact.  Instead it's meant to
+alleviate the perception of one to a customer.
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+
+None
+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+
+None
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+A potential performance impact is present since the proposed solution would
+involve issuing requests to the keystone service.  Therefore it's important
+to utilize caching of the credentials that are returned so as to minimize
+network traffic.
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+In order to take advantage of this feature, the credential must be prepopulated
+in the keystone credential store prior to starting the nova compute instance.
+In order to do this, a user would need to use curl, REST client, or some other
+script to create the credential in keystone. The keystone-client does not
+support creation of credentials (mostly because of the lack of v3 support).
+The future openstack-client does allow creation of credentials, but only of
+type 'ec2' and 'cert'. In the future, hopefully the openstack-client could be
+extended to allow an type as the API does.
+
+Usage
+
+* Create credential in keystone with type='vmware', host_ip matching that in
+  nova.conf, and user_id of the nova user.
+* Edit /etc/nova/nova.conf and remove host_username and host_password from the
+  vmware section.
+* Restart that nova compute instance. Check for errors.

+
+Work Items
+----------
+
+* Create a set of convenience functions for looking up a vCenter credential
+  based on a given host name or IP address.
+* Modify VMware driver to use convenience functions.
+* Modify openstack-client to allow creation of vmware type credentials (only
+  ec2 supported today). 
+
+
+Dependencies
+============
+
+* Currently Nova is already dependent on the use of the keystone-client for
+  middleware.  This proposal would also add a dependency on the use of keystone
+  v3 in order to access its credential store.  To date, Nova has not yet had
+  any keystone v3 dependency.  
+
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+Addition of tempest tests is probably not necessary.  Tempest is currently
+driver agnostic and this change is VMware specific.
+
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+The documentation of the use of the Nova VMware driver would need to be updated
+to state that use of the host_username and host_password could be optional
+instead of required in nova.conf.  The docs would need to describe how someone
+can populate the keystone credential store with this user and password to take
+advantage of this feature.
