+Nova Server HTTP Proxy
+======================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/server-http-proxy
+
+An HTTP proxy on 169.254.169.254 to allow OpenStack API calls from nova
+servers launched within private neutron networks.
+
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+It is becoming increasingly necessary for heat-provisioned nova servers
+to be able to perform requests against OpenStack endpoints. However since
+access to OpenStack endpoints is determined by the neutron network resources
+which the server is attached to, a trade-off is currently required between
+a server which can make the required API calls and a server which is in the
+desired network architecture.
+
+Examples of API calls which a server could legitimately make include:
+
+* Polling for heat resource metadata so that configuration changes can be
+  triggered when the metadata changes
+
+* Signalling to heat the output values of a completed configuration task
+
+* Pushing custom metrics to ceilometer to provide data for alarming or scaling
+  policies (eg, request latency)
+
+* Reading or writing to a swift object, using the object as a webhook or a
+  place to store data too large to transfer via other API calls
+
+* Push and poll to Marconi queues
+
+* Using credentials to generate a keystone token to use for all of the above
+
+There are some aspects of this problem which have been solved already,
+including the following:
+
+* Credentials are created by heat which are scoped to only that server, and
+  can also be limited by roles policy to only be able to make a limited set
+  of API calls
+
+* The neutron-metadata-agent allows the nova metadata API on 169.254.169.254
+  to be accessed from servers even when in private neutron networks
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+* An HTTP proxy is implemented in the nova metadata API, accessible via
+  169.254.169.254
+
+* OpenStack clients on the server are invoked with HTTP_PROXY pointing
+  at 169.254.169.254 with the provided credentials
+
+* The nova-api proxy is configured to only proxy requests to a white-list
+  of OpenStack endpoints
+
+Points for further discussion, in this spec review, or in a Design Summit
+session include whether:
+
+* the http-proxy endpoint should be in a sub-path of 169.254.169.254:80
+  or on a different port on 169.254.169.254
+
+* the implementation should occur in nova-api or neutron-metadata-agent
+
+* using paste.proxy meets the needs for implementing the proxy, or if a new
+  dependency or an in-tree proxy implementation is required
+
+* whether the white-list endpoints should be explicitly configured in nova.conf,
+  or if the white-list config only lists service names and a keystone lookup is
+  performed to confirm if the endpoint is valid, or if the white-list should
+  just be derived from all endpoints in the keystone catalog.
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+None
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+None, except for a new path which represents the proxy URL
+
+OpenStack client operations can be performed from nova provisioned servers
+if they are invoked with the following
+* HTTP_PROXY url
+* valid credentials
+* keystone endpoint
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+
+A private neutron network may have been chosen due to the sensitive workloads
+within it so the following security implications need to be considered:
+
+* Can a compromised server be used to get information out of the private network
+* Can a compromised user account perform actions on servers within the private
+  network which wouldn't otherwise be possible if the proxy was disabled
+
+The above 2 points needs to be considered for every API operation which is
+allowed to proxy via this mechanism. It could be that in the long term a user
+will want to be able to specify what proxying is allowed during nova boot.
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+
+None
+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+
+None
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+* Increased load on nova-api
+
+* Increased load on keystone
+
+* Increased load on neutron-metadata-agent
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+A deployer needs to decide whether they will enable this feature, and possibly
+what API operations they will allow via this proxy method.
+
+The current intent would be for the default configuration to enable proxying
+of an agreed-upon list of API operations
+
+Developer impact
+----------------
+
+None
+
+
+Implementation
+==============
+
+Assignee(s)
+-----------
+
+Primary assignee:
+  Steve Baker (steve-stevebaker)
+
+Work Items
+----------
+
+* Implement proxy in nova-api
+* Implement nova configuration for proxy policy
+* Implement neutron-metadata-agent forwarding to proxy if port is other than 80
+
+
+Dependencies
+============
+
+Will evaluate paste.proxy as being suitable for this feature. Otherwise will
+investigate options for an in-tree proxy implementation or a new library
+dependency.
+
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+This can be tested in tempest by modifying the existing heat tests to launch
+nova servers in private networks, the assert that the existing server operations
+still work via the proxy.
+
+There are no known infrastructure barriers to testing this in the current
+gate environment.
+
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+* Document the nova.conf policy configuration
+* Document what the proxy URL will be and how to configure an OpenStack client
+  to use it.
+
+Impact on the docs team should be minimal.
