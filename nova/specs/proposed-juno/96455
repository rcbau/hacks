Subject: [PATCH] Enable online extend of in-use Cinder volumes

Online volume extend allows volumes that are attached to instances (in-use)
to be extended without first detaching them. This spec defines a Nova
extension that is required by Cinder to issue an online volume extend,
specifically this requires iSCSI rescan and the ability to return the size of
the volume block device from the compute host that the instance is running on.

+Enable online extend of in-use Cinder volumes
+=============================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/online-volume-extend-extension
+
+Online volume extend allows volumes that are attached to instances (in-use)
+to be extended without first detaching them. This spec defines a Nova
+extension that is required by Cinder to issue an online volume extend,
+specifically this requires iSCSI rescan and the ability to return the size of
+the volume block device from the compute host that the instance is running on.
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+Currently Cinder volumes must be detached from instances before they can be
+extended. In cases where services are using the volume (e.g., a Trove
+instance running MySQL), these services must be stopped, causing downtime
+for the user. For Cinder to extend in-use volumes, it needs the compute host
+that the instance is running on to be able to issue an iSCSI rescan and
+return the size of the volume block device so Cinder can poll until the block
+device is actually the new size. Online extend also requires support from the
+underlying hypervisor and volume backend.
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+To support Cinder online extend this spec proposes a corresponding Nova
+extension to run the following on the underlying compute host (via the virt
+driver):
+
+* Rescan iSCSI. This will allow the underlying compute host to see the new
+  size of the volume block device after it has been extended by Cinder.
+
+* Get volume block device size. This will allow Cinder to poll until the
+  underlying block device is actually the new size on the compute host before
+  Cinder completes the online extend.
+
+This initial proposal only covers the minimum required components for some
+hypervisors, specifically those that do not require any additional hooks
+to expose the updated size of the volume block device inside instances.
+Additional work would be required to support this extension for other virt
+drivers (see additional comments in Developer impact).
+
+The Cinder portion of the online extend feature is proposed in [1]_.
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+The main alternative is simply to detach the volume for extend, which is
+already supported, and requires services using the volume to be offline.
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+None
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+Add os-online_extend_volume extension with the following API calls:
+
+PUT v2/{tenant_id}/servers/{server_id}/os-online_extend_volume
+
+* Issues an iSCSI rescan on the compute host with the instance and volume
+* Normal http response code: 202
+* Expected error http response code: 404: Instance not found
+* JSON schema definition for the body data::
+
+    {
+        "volume_id": "string"
+    }
+
+* JSON schema definition for the response data: None
+* Example use case:
+
+  Request:
+
+  PUT v2/fa83baf8315542229f39af36aa643206/servers/822b2c1b-e4c4-4b12-\
+      b28e-35ca7f036edb/os-online_extend_volume
+
+  Body::
+
+    {
+        "volume_id": "e5f556d2-3cfe-4ef1-9ddd-6ddb07d9b9b4",
+    }
+
+  Response: HTTP 202/Accepted
+
+* Policy changes: Requires admin API access or it must be explicitly
+  enabled by an admin in policy.json
+
+GET v2/{tenant_id}/servers/{server_id}/os-online_extend_volume/{volume_id}
+
+* Get the block device size of a volume on the compute host where it is
+  attached to a server
+* Normal http response code: 200
+* Expected error http response code: 404: Instance not found
+* JSON schema definition for the body data: None
+* JSON schema definition for the response data::
+
+    {
+        "blockdev": {
+            "volume_id": "string",
+            "bytes": integer
+        }
+    }
+
+* Example use case:
+
+  Request:
+
+  GET v2/fa83baf8315542229f39af36aa643206/servers/822b2c1b-e4c4-4b12-\
+      b28e-35ca7f036edb/os-online_extend_volume/e5f556d2-3cfe-4ef1-9ddd-\
+      6ddb07d9b9b4
+
+  Response: HTTP 200/OK
+
+  ::
+
+    {
+        "blockdev":{
+            "volume_id": "e5f556d2-3cfe-4ef1-9ddd-6ddb07d9b9b4",
+            "bytes": 4294967296
+        }
+    }
+
+* Policy changes: Requires admin API access or it must be explicitly
+  enabled by an admin in policy.json
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+
+None
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+
+None
+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+
+These Nova operations are included in novaclient for Cinder, however, users
+will simply perform an online extend via Cinder if a deployer has it enabled.
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+Both of the calls in this extension require calls to the underlying compute
+host. Rescan is non-blocking and getting block device size is blocking.
+However, these calls should only be made when a user has issued an online
+extend from Cinder.
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+The online extend extension is disabled by default for users and therefore
+it must be explicitly enabled in Cinder and Nova by a deployer if they
+have the required hypervisor and volume backend support.
+
+Developer impact
+----------------
+
+In addition to backend volume support, other virt drivers may support this
+extension as-is if they do not require any additional mechanisms to notify
+running instances of updated block device sizes. Libvirt versions that
+support block resize would likely need an additional call to notify the
+running instance of the new volume block device size.

+
+Implementation
+==============
+
+Assignee(s)
+-----------
+
+Primary assignee:
+  paulvmarshall
+
+Work Items
+----------
+
+Add online extend extension with two API calls: rescan and get block device
+size.
+
+Add rescan to compute manager, compute rpc api, and the virt driver interface.
+
+Add get block device size to compute manager, compute rpc api, and the virt
+driver interface.
+
+Add unit tests for both rescan and get block device size.
+
+Add rescan and get block device size calls to novaclient.
+
+
+Dependencies
+============
+
+The initial implementation requires backend volume support as well as
+hypervisors that do not require additional mechanisms to expose updated
+block device sizes to instances, such as OpenVZ:
+https://github.com/stackforge/openvz-nova-driver
+
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+The initial implementation of this extension is disabled by default and
+requires special hypervisor and volume backend support (e.g., OpenVZ and HP
+LH SAN), therefore, it will only be tested by unit tests and non-gate 3rd
+party tests.
+
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+None. Documentation will be included for Cinder.
