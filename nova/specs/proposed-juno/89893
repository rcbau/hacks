+Isolate Scheduler Database
+==========================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/isolate-scheduler-db
+
+We want to split out nova-scheduler into gantt. To do this, this blueprint is
+the second stage after scheduler-lib split. These two blueprints are
+independent however.
+
+In this blueprint, we need to isolate all accesses to the database that
+Scheduler is doing and refactor code (manager, filters,
+weighters) so that scheduler is only internally accessing scheduler-related
+tables or resources.
+
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+In order to make decisions, the scheduler needs to know the state of very
+different Nova objects depending on which filter to run, like aggregates or
+instance groups. At the moment, the scheduler is directly reading values from
+DB or conductor while it should not, if we want to do a clean split.
+
+Here we can consider two distinct concerns :
+
+* things that scheduler should know (and persist) which are related to compute
+  nodes should by updated by ResourceTracker using update_available_resource()
+  or when instance_claim() (like aggregates whose host belongs to)
+
+* things the scheduler needs about the wider context of a specific scheduling
+  request need to be passed into select_destinations scheduler lib call, e.g.
+  instance groups
+
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+As said, this blueprint will focus on removing all accesses to other Nova
+objects for the Scheduler code. Filters will only either look at request_spec,
+filter_properties and compute_nodes table in order to make decisions.
+
+As of now, we identified so far four external Nova objects that are accessed
+externally by the Scheduler : aggregates (including AZ metadata), instance
+groups, instances and servicegroup API.
+
+Note: This blueprint is *not* targeting to replace calls to other Nova
+libraries such as nova.pci.pci_request or nova.compute.vm_states if
+these libraries only manipulate local dicts that are not persisted to DB or
+calling conductor.
+
+Below is the summary of where each distinct Nova object is identified in
+nova.scheduler namespace :
+
+* Aggregates (and AZs) (calls n.db.aggregate_metadata_get_by_host):
+
+  * AggregateImagePropertiesIsolation,
+  * AggregateInstanceExtraSpecsFilter,
+  * AggregateMultiTenancyIsolation,
+  * AvailabilityZoneFilter,
+  * AggregateCoreFilter (calls n.objects.aggregate.AggregateList.get_by_host)
+  * AggregateRamFilter (calls n.objects.aggregate.AggregateList.get_by_host)
+  * AggregateTypeAffinityFilter (calls
+    n.objects.aggregate.AggregateList.get_by_host)
+
+* Instance Groups:
+
+  * FilterScheduler._setup_instance_group (calls
+    nova.objects.instance_group_obj.InstanceGroup.get_by_hint)
+
+* Compute API for Instances:
+
+  * TypeAffinityFilter
+  * SameHostFilter
+  * DifferentHostFilter
+
+* ServiceGroup API:
+
+  * nova.scheduler.driver.Scheduler.hosts_up()
+  * ComputeFilter
+
+0. For aggregates allocation ratios (AggregateCoreFilter and
+   AggregateRamFilter), it will be covered by
+   bp/allocation-ratio-to-resource-tracker from jaypipes
+
+1. For InstanceGroups, proposal is made to move _setup_instance_group in
+   scheduler.utils and call it by conductor.manager.build_instances.
+
+2. Regarding accesses to aggregates table for other filters (see above) which
+   lookup aggregates of the host to get metadata corresponding to the filter,
+   we propose the following :
+
+  - Compute host reports to Scheduler (thanks to update_resource_stats) a extra
+    set of details (thanks to Extensible Resource Tracker blueprint) like :
+
+    - metadata "filter_tenant_id" from aggregates he is part of
+    - metadata "availability_zone" from aggregates he is part of
+    - all the metadata from aggregates he is part of (for extra specs filter)
+    - etc.
+
+  - Filters will look into HostState (populated thanks to Extensible RT
+    counterside in Scheduler) to access what they need
+
+    ie. the idea is to move the call to Aggregates object made at the moment
+    in the filter into a resource plugin called by Extensible Resource Tracker.
+
+    The current proposal implies that if a resource plugin is disabled for
+    performance reasons, the corresponding filter won't be able to decide.
+    That approach allows to reduce dramatically the number of calls to the
+    necessary ones defined by the operator.
+
+    On a mid-term view, we don't avoid ourselves to think about versioning
+    capabilities for plugins and possibly discovery features either from
+    Scheduler or from Computes to make sure both are talking the same
+    language.
+
+3. For instances, we propose a very close approach :
+
+  - RT.update_available_resource calls Extensible RT plugins, whom one is
+    responsible for reporting either instance UUIDs running on the host (for
+    SameHost and DifferentHost filters) and another one is responsible for
+    reporting all instance flavors on the host
+
+  - filters will look into HostState to know if host runs the instance asked in
+    the hint
+
+4. For ServiceGroups, nothing will be done in this blueprint (considering that
+   it will only be modified in Gantt).
+
+
+In order to provide compatibility in between distinct releases of compute nodes
+and scheduler, the idea is, for each filter, to check HostState if the field
+is there, and if not failback to calling the corresponding Nova object.
+So, Juno scheduler filters will have compatibility filters and upgrade to Kilo
+will see the failback mode removed (because Juno computes will provide stats)
+
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+Instead of passing data to the scheduler either thru RT or request property, we
+could let the scheduler place a call to conductor for having these values. That
+said, the problem here is that it increases response time (external call
+instead of direct DB access) and also creates an external dependency with Nova
+objects that would require to be turned into python-novaclient call once Gantt
+forklifted.
+Reporting aggregates capabilities (eg. metadata) can also be designed in
+various different ways, like having the conductor placing a call to aggregates
+and providing it in request_spec, or copying all the aggregate data in
+compute_nodes or moving the whole aggregate concept into the scheduler for its
+solely use, but we think the proposal we made is the most performance-wise.
+
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+None, as no other data except JSON will be changed in compute_nodes. There is
+no extra information to persist, as we will provide extra required data for
+filters either in request_spec or filter_properties.
+
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+None
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+
+None
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+
+None.
+
+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+
+None
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+Possibly some little increases in performance as the scheduler won't no longer
+access other Nova objects thru conductor but rather will look at
+filter_properties or request_spec that are passed thru RPC payload.
+
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+As said above, it's up to the deployer to synchronize which plugins are
+reporting stats to the scheduler with which filters he wants to run.
+
+Developer impact
+----------------
+
+Ideally:
+
+* Filters should no longer place calls to other bits of code except Scheduler.
+  This will be done by modifying Scheduler component to proxy conductor calls
+  to a Singleton which will refuse anything but scheduler-related objects.
+  See footnote [1] as example. As said above, we will still provide a failback
+  mode for Juno release in order to have compatibility with N-1 release.
