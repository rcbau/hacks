+Persist scheduler hints
+===========================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/persist-scheduler-hints
+
+The aim of this feature is to persist scheduler hints when creating
+VM instance so that the scheduler hints can be available for the whole
+VM life cycle.
+
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+When creating VM instance with scheduler hints, scheduler hints will
+only take effect at deploying time. After the VM was deployed, scheduler
+hints will be lost.
+
+Later on when an admin tries to migrate the VM, this VM can be migrated to
+a host which might violated the original scheduler hints. The same problems
+also exist for resize, cold migration etc.
+
+The proposed solution is to store scheduler hints so that it can be available
+for the whole life cycle of the VM instance, this can make sure the VM can
+retrieve and evaluate the scheduler hints before doing some VM operations
+so as to make sure the VM will always obey its scheduler hints during its
+life cycle.
+
+It is up to the admin to decide if they want to obey scheduler hints when
+doing VM operations but the scheduler hints will always be there.
+
+For example, when admin creates a vm with different_host scheduler hints, then
+when migrate the VM, the VM will always migrate to different hosts specified
+by scheduler hints.
+
+Create a VM with different host filter: nova boot --image test --flavor 1
+--hint different_host=1-1-1-1-1 vm1
+
+Migrate the VM instance with scheduler validation: nova live-migration vm1
+--scheduler_validation, Nova scheduler will help select the best target host
+for live migration which can satisfy the different host scheduler hints.
+
+Migrate the VM instance without scheduler validation: nova live-migration vm1,
+if not specify scheduler_validation, the scheduler hints will be ignored by
+nova scheduler. This will be covered by bp validate-targethost-live-migration.
+
+This blueprint was mainly for persisting the scheduler hints to nova instance
+database and also enable "nova show" can list the scheduler hints.
+
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+* A new field named as scheduler_hints will be added to the table of
+  instances, its type is text.
+* A new field named as scheduler_hints will be added to instance object,
+  its type is DictOfNullableStringsField.
+* Update nova api to enable persisting scheduler hints when creating VM
+  instance.
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+None
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+* Add a new field scheduler_hints to the table of instances to persist
+  scheduler hints.
+* Add script for DB upgrade and downgrade.
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+* Enable "nova show" can list scheduler hints for both V2 and V3 API.
+* Both admin and normal user can get scheduler hints.
+* For V2 API, need add an API extension to enable this feature.
+* Response body for V2 API::
+
+       server = {
+                     "id": uuid,
+                     "user_id": "fake_user",
+                     "tenant_id": "fake_project",
+                     "updated": "2010-11-11T11:00:00Z",
+                     "created": "2010-10-10T12:00:00Z",
+                     "progress": progress,
+                     "name": "server1",
+                     "status": status,
+                     "accessIPv4": "",
+                     "accessIPv6": "",
+                     "hostId": "",
+                     "OS-SCH-HNT:scheduler_hints": "{'foo': 'bar'}"
+       }
+
+* Response body for V3 API::
+
+       server = {
+                     "id": uuid,
+                     "user_id": "fake_user",
+                     "tenant_id": "fake_project",
+                     "updated": "2010-11-11T11:00:00Z",
+                     "created": "2010-10-10T12:00:00Z",
+                     "progress": progress,
+                     "name": "server1",
+                     "status": status,
+                     "os-access-ips:access_ip_v4": "",
+                     "os-access-ips:access_ip_v6": "",
+                     "host_id": "",
+                     "os-scheduler-hints:scheduler_hints": "{'foo': 'bar'}"
+       }
