Subject: [PATCH] Remove Fakelibvirt

Using `fakelibvirt` can lead to situations where tests pass locally but fail
on Jenkins. This spec proposes to remove `fakelibvirt` and instead skip
Libvirt tests if real `libvirt` isn't present.

+Remove Fakelibvirt
+==================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/remove-fakelibvirt
+
+Using `fakelibvirt` can lead to situations where tests pass locally but fail on
+Jenkins. This spec proposes to remove `fakelibvirt` and instead skip Libvirt
+tests if real `libvirt` isn't present.
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+The Libvirt tests use the real `libvirt` Python module if it's installed or
+`fakelibvirt` if it's not.
+
+Since `fakelibvirt` can fall out-of-sync with real `libvirt` this leads to a
+situation where tests can pass locally (using `fakelibvirt`) but fail on
+Jenkins (which uses some version of real `libvirt`).
+
+The current solution to the divergence problem is to continually update
+`fakelibvirt` as `libvirt` changes, sometimes even involving a wholesale copy
+of code from `libvirt` into the `nova` tree [1]_.
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+We should remove the `fakelibvirt` module entirely.
+
+If a developer does not have real `libvirt` installed, this would cause the
+tests to fail. So, using the database migration tests as a model, we should
+skip the Libvirt tests if we detect that `libvirt` is not importable.
+
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+* NO CHANGE: We could do nothing, but this means we may have to continue to
+  sync `fakelibvirt` which is overhead; but more importantly, since the tests
+  are really integration tests to a large degree, mocking this out means that
+  we're not testing much of anything.
+
+* REQUIRE LIBVIRT: We could remove `fakelibvirt` but not skip tests. This
+  would require *all* Nova developers to have `libvirt` installed in order for
+  tests to pass. This would prevent Mac developers from developing locally as
+  `libvirt` doesn't install cleanly.
+
+* ONLY FAKELIBVIRT: We could remove the import check and instead have both
+  Jenkins and local developers use `fakelibvirt` exclusively. The benefit is
+  that it's consistent across environments. The drawback is we're going to
+  need to keep `fakelibvirt` in sync with real `libvirt` and we're likely to
+  have bugs in `fakelibvirt` which cause tests to pass both locally and
+  Jenkins but result in production bugs.
+
+* REWRITE TESTS: The suggestion here is rewrite all of our libvirt tests so
+  that we don't actually ever talk to a `libvirt` client at all. This supposes
+  that the Tempest tests are sufficient for integration tests.
+
+  The pro is that we'd have consistency across environments, and as
+  unit-tests, they'd be blazingly fast.
+
+  The downside are that:
+
+    * We'd have to rewrite all of our tests, a considerable effort
+
+    * Tempest tests are probably not sufficient because we probably want more
+      fine-grained, in-tree integration tests for Nova. Tempest is great for
+      testing integration between Neutron and Nova, but not as ideal for
+      testing integration between `nova/virt/libvirt/driver.py:spawn` and
+      `libvirt:createDomain`.
