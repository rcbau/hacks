+============================================
+VMware resource pool enablement for VCenter
+============================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/vmware-resource-pool-enablement
+
+To enable the resource pool in VCenter as a target, where the VM can
+be deployed.
+
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+Right now the nova compute node can deploy the VM on a specified cluster in
+VCenter. Resource pool, as another important concept to group the compute
+resource, has not been implemented as a target for a VM to deploy on.
+This proposal will bring this resource pool into VCenter driver, so that
+the nova compute node can deploy the VM to a specified resource pool under a
+cluster or under a host.
+In this proposal, the cluster is directly under the data center of the VCenter,
+so is the host.
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+The idea will introduce the following changes:
+
+ * Add a new flag resource_pool in nova.conf for VMware. This flag is used
+   together with cluster_name as a combination to specify the resource
+   pool, because the resource pool can be either under a cluster or a host.
+
+1) For the resource pool under a cluster: the cluster_name is used to set the
+cluster name and the resource_pool is used to set the cluster and the resource
+pool name with a colon to split them For example, a resource pool named "pool"
+is under a cluster named "cluster1". We will set cluster_name=cluster1 and
+resource_pool=cluster1:pool. If the name before the colon(:) exists in
+cluster_name as well, we know this name is a cluster name and this resource pool
+is under a cluster. Besides the resource pool, the other clusters specified by
+cluster_name will be taken as the available node as well for the VMs to deploy.
+
+2)For the resource pool directly under a host directly in the VCenter data
+center: use resource_pool to specify the host and the resource pool name.
+For example, a resource pool named "pool" is under a host named "host1".
+We can set resource_pool=host1:pool, and DO NOT set "host1" in cluster_name,
+so we know the name before the colon(:) is the host name. This is the mechanism
+to determine whether the resource pool is under a cluster or under a host.
+Besides the resource pool, the other clusters specified by cluster_name will be
+taken as the available node as well for the VMs to deploy.
+
+ * In the method of spawning a VM, the resource pool specified in nova.conf
+   will be returned as the place to launch the VM.
+
+Examples of configurations:
+1. cluster_name=cluster1,cluster_name=cluster2,resource_pool=cluster1:rp1,
+resource_pool=cluster1:rp2
+With this configuration, we specify rp1 under cluster1, rp2 under cluster1 and
+cluster2 as the targets to deploy the VMs. Since cluster1 is used together
+with a resource pool name in resource_pool, this cluster will not be taken
+as the target for VMs to deploy, but the resource pools will be.
+
+2. cluster_name=cluster1,cluster_name=cluster2,resource_pool=host1:rp1
+With this configuration, we specify rp1 under host1, cluster1 and cluster2 as
+the targets to deploy the VMs. Neither cluster1 nor cluster2 is used in
+resource_pool, so the resource pool will be a pool under a host. The resource
+pool and two of the specified clusters will be the target for VMs to deploy.
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+Use the current cluster_name in nova.conf to specify the cluster or the resource
+pool. However, it makes cluster_name complicated to parse, since a lot of
+cases need to be taken into account. For example, we to differentiate the
+resource pool under a cluster from the resource pool under a host, because it is
+different for each of them to retrieve the resource pool. This alternative makes
+it hard to do so.

+Data model impact

+Performance Impact
+------------------
+None
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+In nova.conf, the deployer can configure the resource pool(s) as the target,
+where the VMs are going to deploy.
+
+Developer impact
+----------------
+
+In VMware VCenter driver, a general method of returning the MOR of an
+resource pool by giving the name will be added. Other developers can use
+it to retrieve a resource pool reference.

+
+Work Items
+----------
+
+ * Add a new flag resource_pool for VMware in nova.conf.
+
+ * Implement the deployment a VM into a resource pool under a cluster.
+
+ * Implement the deployment a VM into a resource pool under a host directly in
+   the data center of VCenter.
+
+ * Extend the flag resource_pool into Multi-string option, so that multiple
+   resource pools can be set as the targets for one nova compute node.
+
+
+Dependencies
+============
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/vmware-spawn-refactor
+This proposal will be based on the vmware-spawn-refactor work.
+
+
+Testing
+=======
+New test cases need to be added for deploying the VM into a resource pool.
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+The resource pool configurations need to be added for the VMwareVCDriver.
