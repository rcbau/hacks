+=========================================
+Return all servers during multiple create
+=========================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/return-all-servers-during-multiple-create
+
+In this blueprint, we propose to improve the server create API in V3 by
+including all of the created servers in the response instead of only the first
+server. In V2, servers[0] is returned to the caller in response to a create
+request that has specified min/max_count.
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+End users of the server create API have the ability to create multiple
+instances in one batch by specifying min/max_count in the request. One reason
+to use this ability is to scale up a cloud-hosted application quickly or in
+response to increased load. Upon requesting multiple servers, the user needs to
+know the list of servers that have been created in order to work with them. It
+would be ideal to receive the list in the response for the create request.
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+In order to provide the end user with the list of created servers most
+efficiently, we propose to change the server create API response in V3 from
+returning only one server to returning a list of servers. In the case when the
+end user has requested creation of just one server, a list containing one
+server will be returned.
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+Callers can work around in V2 by specifying return_reservation_id=True in the
+request to receive a reservation ID which they can use to obtain the list of
+servers. This is also currently possible in V3, but it requires an additional
+API call to get the server list.
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+None
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+V3 API specification:
+
+ * Description: Create one or more servers
+
+ * Method type: POST
+
+ * Normal http response code: 202
+
+ * Expected error http response codes:
+
+  * 400: Invalid request parameter, image/flavor not found
+
+  * 409: Port in use, no unique match
+
+  * 413: Quota or port limit exceeded
+
+ * URL: v3/servers
+
+ * Example JSON request (no change)::
+
+    {
+        "server": {
+            "name": "server-test-1",
+            "image_ref": "b5660a6e-4b46-4be3-9707-6b47221b454f",
+            "flavor_ref": "2",
+            "max_count": 2,
+            "min_count": 2
+    }
+
+ * Example JSON response (new format)::
+
+    {
+        "servers": [
+            {
+                "admin_password": "qpYU66rKxmnK",
+                "id": "215d1109-216d-48c3-af8e-998bb9bc3ca0",
+                "links": [
+                    {
+                        "href": "http://openstack.example.com/v3/servers/<id>",
+                        "rel": "self"
+                    },
+                    {
+                        "href": "http://openstack.example.com/servers/<id>",
+                        "rel": "bookmark"
+                    }
+                ]
+            },
+            {
+                "admin_password": "wfksH3GTTseP",
+                "id": "440cf918-3ee0-4143-b289-f63e1d2000e6",
+                "links": [
+                    {
+                        "href": "http://openstack.example.com/v3/servers/<id>",
+                        "rel": "self"
+                    },
+                    {
+                        "href": "http://openstack.example.com/servers/<id>",
+                        "rel": "bookmark"
+                    }
+                ]
+            }
+        ]
+    }
+
+ * Partial JSON response schema definition to show change::
+
+    create = {
+        'type': 'object',
+        'properties': {
+            'servers': {
+                'type': 'array',
+                'items': {
+                    'type': 'object',
+                    'properties: {
+                        'admin_password': {type': 'string'},
+                        'id': {'type': 'string'},
+                        'links': {

+                            'items': {
+                                'type': 'object',
+                                'properties': {
+                                    'href': {'type': 'string'},
+                                    'rel': {'type': 'string'}
+                                }
+                            }
+                        }
+                    }
+                }
+            }

+    }
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+
+None
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+
+None
+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+
+The python-novaclient will have to be changed to handle the list of servers in
+the V3 API server create response and show the list to the user.
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+For a server create API request for multiple servers, instead of returning only
+the first server, all of the created server objects must be serialized and
+returned in the response instead of just the first one.
+
+Other deployer impact

+
+Work Items
+----------
+
+ * Change the V3 API response for server create to return a list of instances.
+
+ * Update tests in tempest to handle the changed response.
+
+Dependencies
+============
+
+This blueprint is related to the tasks API blueprint [1] because it needs to
+interact with how tasks will work in V3. Initial comments on this interaction
+are available in the original review [2].
+
+[1] https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/instance-tasks-api
+
+[2] https://review.openstack.org/#/c/54214/
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+Tempest tests must be updated to accept the changed server create API
+response format. Tempest tests already exercise the various server creation
+scenarios, but the response format has changed for V3.
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+The changed REST API response for server create, as represented by the
+jsonschema definition above, will need to be documented. The changed API
+response will be available as API samples generated from testing.
