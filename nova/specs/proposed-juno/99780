Subject: [PATCH] Libvirt: Fsfreeze during live-snapshot of qemu/kvm instances

This blueprint proposes automatic quiesce feature during snapshotting
an image of an instance using qemu-guest-agent and fsFreeze/fsThaw API
in libvirt >= 1.2.5.

+=====================================================================
+Quiescing filesystems with QEMU guest agent during image snapshotting
+=====================================================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/quiesced-image-snapshots-with-qemu-guest-agent
+
+When QEMU Guest Agent is installed in a kvm instance, we can request the
+instance to freeze filesystems via libvirt during snapshotting to make the
+snapshot consistent.
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+Currently we need to quiesce filesystems (fsfreeze) manually before
+snapshotting an image of active instances to create consistent backups.
+This should be automated when QEMU Guest Agent is enabled.
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+When QEMU Guest Agent is enabled in an instance, Nova-compute libvirt driver
+will request the agent to freeze the filesystems (and applications if
+fsfreeze-hook is installed) before taking snapshot of the image.
+After taking snapshot, the driver will request the agent to thaw the
+filesystems.
+
+The prerequisites of this feature are:
+
+1. the hypervisor is 'qemu' or 'kvm'
+
+2. libvirt >= 1.2.5 (which has fsFreeze/fsThaw API) is installed in the
+   hypervisor
+
+3. 'hw_qemu_guest_agent=yes' property in the image metadata is set to 'yes'
+   and QEMU Guest Agent is installed and enabled in the instance
+
+When quiesce is failed even though these conditions are satisfied
+(e.g. the agent is not responding), snapshotting may fail by exception
+not to get inconsistent snapshots.
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+Rewrite nova's snapshotting with libvirt's domain.reateSnapshot API with
+VIR_DOMAIN_SNAPSHOT_CREATE_QUIESCE flag, although it will change the current
+naming scheme of disk images. In addition, it cannot be leveraged to implement
+live snapshot of cinder volumes.

+
+Implement the automatic quiesce during snapshotting when it is available.
+Now the code is ready to  review: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/72038/

+
+Testing
+=======
+
+Live snapshotting with an image with qemu-guest-agent should be added to
+scenario tests.
+Note that it requires environment with libvirt >= 1.2.5.
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+Need to document how to use this feature in the operation guide (which
+currently recommends you use the fsfreze tool manually).
