Subject: [PATCH] support multiple image backends for libvirt driver

Currently, the cloud administrator can not choose ephemeral storage backend
device (e.g. SSD or non-SSD) and driver (e.g. qcow2 or ceph) for per flavor.
The lack of these features restrict the price strategy for different
performance and functional requirements. So we should add support to
configure multiple libvirt image backends, and then in the flavor
indicate which backend should be used for per instance.

+support multiple image backends for libvirt driver
+===============================================================

+
+Currently, the cloud administrator can not choose ephemeral storage backend
+device (e.g. SSD or non-SSD) and driver (e.g. qcow2 or ceph) for per flavor.
+The lack of these features restrict the price strategy for different
+performance and functional requirements. So we should add support to
+configure multiple libvirt image backends, and then in the flavor
+indicate which backend should be used for per instance.
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+1. The administrator have no ability to create flavor with ephemeral
+   storage assigned on SSD as some Amazon EC2 instance types (e.g. m3.large).
+
+2. The administrator have no ability to choose among different libvirt
+   image types for instance disks. To strive for high performance, local disk
+   (e.g. raw/qcow2) may be better. To strive for live migration or single
+   storage backend for glance, nova and cinder, choosing ceph is more 
+   reasonable.
+
+3. The administrator have no ability about more fine grained configuration
+   for ephemeral storage backend, i.e. separately set which backend to be 
+   used for root disk, ephemeral disk and swap disk. For example, there is 
+   the case where the administrator wants some flavours with root disk and
+   swap disk on SSD, and other flavors with only swap disk on SSD.
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+1. The <libvirt_image_type> in nova.conf would need to allow a list of image
+   backend names + types, and we use existing config parameters:
+   raw/qcow2-<instances_path>,
+   lvm-<libvirt_images_volume_group>,
+   rbd-<libvirt_images_rbd_pool>.
+
+   these parameters need to be extended to allow a list of values, instead of
+   a single value. For example, if we want to do a choice of local qcow2 and 
+   two rbd pools, one of which is fast ssd backend, we should configure:
+   libvirt_image_type=default:qcow2, fast:qcow2, shared:rbd, sharedfast:rbd
+   instance_path=default:/var/nova/images/hdd, fast:/var/nova/imges/ssd
+   libvirt_images_rbd_pool=shared:main,sharedfast:mainssd
+
+   The names 'default', 'fast', 'shared', 'sharedfast' are set by deployer
+   freely, and would be used to tag ephemeral storage backend in the flavour.
+
+2. In periodic task about update_available_resource, resource tracker retrieve
+   the detail info of each ephemeral storage back-ends. These info include 
+   backend name, free size, used size and total size.
+
+3. Modify the disk_filter, and then based on ephemeral storage backend type and
+   available size, nova-scheduler choose compute node reasonably.
+
+4. Modify the imagebackend, and then based on ephemeral storage backend type,
+   create_image for root disk, ephemeral disk and swap disk, which involves
+   four image type: raw, qcow2, lvm and rbd.
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+none
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+Add a table compute_node_storage_resource, its fields contain:
+compute_node_id, backend_name, total_size, free_size, used_size
+disk_available_least.
+
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+none
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+
+none
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+
+none
+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+
+None
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+Modify a scheduler filter (i.e. disk filter) and a periodic task
+(i.e. update_available_resource), but not add any new scheduler filters and 
+periodic tasks. So there are little impact on nova. 
+
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+The <libvirt_image_type> in nova.conf allow a list of image backend names
++ types, and we use existing config parameters:
+raw/qcow2-<instances_path>,
+lvm-<libvirt_images_volume_group>,
+rbd-<libvirt_images_rbd_pool>
+
+but these parameters have been extended to allow a list of values, instead of
+a single value. For example, if we want to do a choice of local qcow2 and 
+two rbd pools, one of which is fast ssd backend, we should configure:
+libvirt_image_type=default:qcow2, fast:qcow2, shared:rbd, sharedfast:rbd
+instance_path=default:/var/nova/images/hdd, fast:/var/nova/imges/ssd
+libvirt_images_rbd_pool=shared:main,sharedfast:mainssd
+
+The names 'default', 'fast', 'shared', 'sharedfast' are set by deployer
+freely, and would be used to tag ephemeral storage backend in the flavour.

+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+1. In the installation and configuration guide, we need to add content
+   about how to configure the parameters of libvirt multiple image
+   backends.
+
+2. In the admin guide, we need to add content about how to specify
+   ephemeral storage backend in flavor.
