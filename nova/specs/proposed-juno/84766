+Support Console Log migration during Live-migration
+===================================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/support-console-log-migration
+
+Implement console log migration during live-migration in the libvirt driver
+
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+Currently, in libvirt driver with a kvm hypervisor, console output is written
+to console.log. Nova responds to a get-console-log request with the contents
+of this file and this information is useful for debugging issues during boot
+process. However, during a live-migration the contents of the file in the
+source node is discarded.
+
+There are two issues which play a role in this.
+
+* The new kvm process in the destination would have already started using
+  an empty console log.
+
+* While the migration progresses the VM in the source node will continue
+  to write to the console log.
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+We propose the following in this blueprint to solve this issue without depending
+on kvm.
+
+* Require that VIR_MIGRATE_UNDEFINE_SOURCE is not set. Instead wait for the
+  condition that the instance is shutoff at the source.
+
+* During post-live-migration copy the console log be from source node and save
+  in the destination node as console.log.1. If log rotation is implemented,
+  all the rotated files need to be rotated once.
+
+* Change get-console-log function such that console.log and console.log.1 are
+  merged in the response (within the MAX_CONSOLE_BYTES limit). It log rotation is
+  implemented then the function needs to read as many files as it takes to fill up
+  the MAX_CONSOLE_BYTES limit.
+
+* The source VM would get undefined by the periodic task once the database is
+  updated with the new hostname.
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+* Change qemu to move the file content
+* Stream console output to a shared location
+* If spec/libvirt-serial-console is implemented we can leverage on that
+  mechanism and trigger a rotation and move it to destination.
+

+Data model impact

+Security impact

+
+Notifications impact

+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+None
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+* There's a brief window between the time the VM is activated in the destination
+  and before post-live-migration is completed. Any nova console-log requests will
+  return almost empty content during this window.
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+* If people are using VIR_MIGRATE_UNDEFINE_SOURCE then they need to remove this
+  option to get this feature. If this flag exists we will fallback to not having
+  the console log migrated.
+
+Developer impact

+None

+
+Work Items
+----------
+
+* Change live-migration to wait for shutoff state if flag
+  VIR_MIGRATE_UNDEFINE_SOURCE is not set.
+* Change get_console_log to handle rotated log files
+* Implement console log migration during post-live-migration
+
+Dependencies
+============
+None
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+Tempest tests should be added to test that the console logs are merged in the
+response and catch other corner-cases.
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+We expect to have the following documentation changes:
+
+* The migration flag changes to get console logs migrated
+* Expected empty console log during the VM offline period in the final stages of
+  the migration
