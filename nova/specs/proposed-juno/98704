Subject: [PATCH] VMware nova-Storage optimization for clusters with multiple
 datastores

This blueprint storage-optimization-for-multi-datastore-clusters allows
images to launch faster and saves disk space by creating linked clones
of instances using the base disk already present in the image cache of
other datastore of the ESX cluster.
VMware ESX cluster can have multiple datastores that are shared across all the
hosts of the cluster. Its much more efficient to have a single copy of the
image in only one datastore of the cluster and create linked clones using
this image.

+VMware nova driver storage optimization for clusters with multiple datastores
+=============================================================================

+
+This blueprint storage-optimization-for-multi-datastore-clusters allows images
+to launch faster and saves disk space by creating linked clones of instances
+using the base disk already present in the image cache in another datastore of
+the ESX cluster.
+VMware ESX cluster can have multiple datastores that are shared across all the
+hosts of the cluster. It is much more efficient to have a single copy of the
+image in only one datastore of the cluster and create linked clones using
+this image.
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+ESX clusters can have multiple shared datastores configured.
+A datastore is a logical container that stores the virtual machine files.
+This includes both the disk (vmdk), configuration (vmx) files and
+snapshot files.
+
+A datastore can be created from different types of physical storage
+like local direct attached storage, iSCSI, FC SAN and NFS.
+The physical storage is presented to all host in the cluster and therefore
+the datastore is accessible from all the hosts of the cluster.
+Each cluster will typically have its own set of datastores and this is
+the recommended configuration. This configuration enable the live migration
+of VMs across all hosts of the cluster.
+
+When using the VMware vCenter nova driver for such clusters with
+multiple shared datastores the image can get cached in each datastore.
+Additionally a disk of size equal to the flavor of the instance is also
+created in the cache. Instances are created as linked clones to this flavor
+sized disks.
+This approach has the following problems
+
+* Every time a new datastore is selected by the driver for deployment, a new
+  cache is created on the datastore and the image is copied.
+* A copy of the image expanded to the size of the flavor is created for each
+  instance deployed with a different flavor
+
+This approach leads to a reduction of the actual storage space available for
+creating instances.
+
+In the existing design, when an instance creation is done, the following
+occurs
+
+* Step 1. The driver determines the best datastore to place the instance. It
+  does this by selecting the datastore with maximum free space.
+* Step 2. The existence of the image is checked in the cache
+  (directory named _vmware_base) on the clusters datastore
+* Step 3. If the image is not available in the cache, then
+  (i) the image is downloaded from glance into nova-compute
+  (the VM where the compute service runs)
+  (ii) Then the image is transferred from the nova-compute to the datastore
+  by vCenter
+* Step 4.Instance is spawned using the cached image by first creating a disk
+  of the size of the specified in the flavor (if it doesnt exist). Then
+  creating a linked clone using the flavor sized disk as the base disk.
+
+The problems exist in Step 1 and Step 2 since the the driver is not utilizing
+the cache in other datastores.
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+* 1. The drivers datastore selection can be modified to select the datastore
+  that has the image already cached and if has enough space for the new
+  instance (as per Step 4 above)
+* 2. If the datastore where the image is cached does not have enough space for
+  the new instance, then create a linked clone in a different datastore but
+  still using the cached image as the base disk.
+  This is based on the configuration option set in nova.conf. The
+  configuration parameter is span_datastores.
+  This is configurable because in vCenter a datastore can be placed in
+  maintenance mode. A datastore can be placed in maintenance mode when there
+  are no VMs accessing the datastore. In the case where the instances are
+  referencing base disk in different datastores it would be difficult for the
+  admin to identify the children of a specific base disk and move the disks.
+  By making it configurable, admins who do not use the datastore maintenance
+  feature or admins who can identify dependent disks using scripts can set
+  this option.
+
+  Default would be not to create linked that are across datastores of the
+  cluster (Existing implementation). However the download from glance will be
+  avoided if the image is present in the cache of other datastores. This is
+  the additional change introduced.
+
+  When this option is set, then the linked clone creation is modified so
+  that base disk in another datastore is used.
+
+  When this option is not set, then the following occur:
+  a. The lock on the image is aquired. The lock is the same as the one
+  aquired by the periodic task during image cache cleanup.
+  b. The image is copied from the datastore to the cache of the datastore
+  that is selected for the instance.
+  c. The lock is released
+  d. The existing spawn implementation continues
+  If the lock cannot be aquired since the image was deleted by the image
+  cache cleanup periodic task, then the download from glance will occur.
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+Another alternative is to schedule instances to the clusters that have the
+image already cached. This will work fine until the cluster is at capacity.
+To use this alternative, the following changes will be required
+(1) the VMware nova driver will have to publish the
+list of images in its cache.
+(2) A new scheduler filter will then select the nova-compute (cluster) that
+already has the image in its cache. If there are no clusters that have the
+image then it would return all clusters (existing behaviour). This can be
+implemented using weights as well. This will be addressed a separate
+blueprint (will be submitting this).

+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+Given that in a private cloud there will be different set of standard
+images, and the number of datastores per cluster is generaly more than 1,
+enhancing the datastore selection logic and creating linked clones across
+datastores will significantly improve user experience, reduce instance
+creation times since multiple caches are not created and improve storage
+utilization.
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+None
+
+Developer impact
+----------------
+
+* The similar approach can be used by other nova drivers that support nodes
+  with multiple logical storage where cache is maintained per logical storage.
+* This change only impacts the VMware nova driver. Other drivers will not be
+  impacted due to this change.
