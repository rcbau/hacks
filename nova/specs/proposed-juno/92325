+=========================================================================
+Enable extension policy rule as default of action policy rule for v3 api
+=========================================================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/extension-level-policy-as-default-v3-api
+
+There are a lot of API in V3, and also a lot of policy rule that can be
+configured by deployer. For ease the maintenance burden of policy rules
+configuration, enable deployer to use extension policy rule instead of all
+the action policy rule in the same extension.
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+For some extension, it provide policy rule for each API.
+
+For example:
+    "compute_extension:v3:os-aggregates:index": "rule:admin_api",
+    "compute_extension:v3:os-aggregates:create": "rule:admin_api",
+    "compute_extension:v3:os-aggregates:show": "rule:admin_api",
+    "compute_extension:v3:os-aggregates:update": "rule:admin_api",
+    "compute_extension:v3:os-aggregates:delete": "rule:admin_api",
+    "compute_extension:v3:os-aggregates:add_host": "rule:admin_api",
+    "compute_extension:v3:os-aggregates:remove_host": "rule:admin_api",
+    "compute_extension:v3:os-aggregates:set_metadata": "rule:admin_api",
+
+Actually the rule is same for all the API. If Deployer want to change
+the rule, Deployer need modify for each policy rule.
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+Extension rule: compute_extension:v3:[extension_name]
+Action rule: compute_extension:v3:[extension_name]:[action_name]
+
+If deployer want to set same rule for all the API in an extension, deployer
+just need write a rule for extension. Then that rule will apply to all the API
+in that extensions.
+
+If deployer want to change rule for one of API in that extension, it only
+need write an action policy rule for that API. Then it will override the rule
+of extension.
+
+For example:
+"compute_extension:v3:os-aggregates": "rule:admin_api",
+"compute_extension:v3:os-aggregates:set_metadata": "role:maintainer"
+
+This means the rule of APIs except set_metadata in os-aggregates extension
+is "rule:admin_api". For set_metadata, the rule is "role:maintainer".

+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+If the policy configure file is unchanged, then this is completely backwards
+compatible.
+
+If the policy configure file is changed. There are something need notice:
+When action policy rule is unspecified, without this feature, the default
+rule will be applied. With this feature, the extension policy rule will be
+applied.
+
+Developer impact
+----------------
+A developer should still list every single possible policy setting available
+for the feature they are adding or modifying in policy.json, not just an
+overall policy setting for the extension. A deployer is always free to remove
+more specific settings, but without having an example they would be forced to
+read the nova api code to see what settings are possible.

+Documentation Impact
+====================
+Upgrade impact documentation will need to be written so deployers are aware of
+this new feature.
+
+Developer documentation will need to notice developer list all the new policy
+rule in the policy configure file, that used to have an example for deployer
+knowing which rule they can use.
