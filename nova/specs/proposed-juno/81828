Subject: [PATCH] Scheduler: Adds per-aggregate filters

The aim of this spec is to implement 3 new filters for the
scheduler to provide the ability to set options per-aggreate.

These blueprints was already approved for icehouse.

+=====================================
+Scheduler: Adds per-aggregate filters
+=====================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/per-aggregate-disk-allocation-ratio
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/per-aggregate-max-instances-per-host
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/per-aggregate-max-io-ops-per-host
+
+The aim of this bp is to add the ability to the filters DiskFilter,
+NumInstancesFilter and IoOpsFilter to set our options by aggregates.
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+Operator wants to define different filtering options (disk_allocation_ratio,
+max_instances_per_host, max_io_ops_per_host) for a subset of compute hosts.
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+Create new filters that extend DiskFilter, NumInstancesFilter and
+IoOpsAggregateFilter to provide the ability to read the metadata from
+aggregates. If no valid values found fall back to the global default
+configurations set in nova.conf.

+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+Not related with this bp but a performance impact has been reported
+to the bug 1300775_
+about using aggregate with the scheduler on large
+cluster.
+
+.. _1300775: https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1300775
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+The operator needs to update the scheduler's nova.conf to activate filters,
+also he has to set metadata of the aggregates with the configurations options
+disk_allocation_ratio, max_instances_per_host, max_io_ops_per_host.
+
+::
+
+  $ # This one provides for hosts in the aggregate 'agr1' the possibility to
+  $ # host 60 instances.
+  $ nova aggregate-set-metadata agr1 set metadata max_instances_per_host=60
+
+  $ # This one provides for hosts in the aggregate 'agr2' the possibility to
+  $ # oversubscribe disk allocation and configures the scheduler to ignore
+  $ # hosts that have currently more than 3 heavy operations.
+  $ nova aggregate-set-metadata agr2 set\
+  $   metadata max_io_ops_per_host=3
+  $   disk_allocation_ratio=3
+
+The operator also needs to reload the scheduler service to activate this new
+filter.

+
+Work Items
+----------
+
+ * New filter AggregateNumInstancesFilter
+ * New filter AggregateDiskFilter
+ * New filter AggregateIoOpsFilter
+
+Dependencies
+============
+
+ * A bug has been open to factory per-aggregate logic.
+   https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1301340
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+We need to add unit tests in test_host_filters.py also we probably need to
+think about adding functional tests in tempest.
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+We need to refer these new filters in the documentation, also
+'doc/source/devref/filter_scheduler.rst' needs to be updated.
+
+References
+==========
+
+These blueprints was accepted for icehouse but because of a work started to add
+helper that provides utility methods to get metadata from aggregates and so
+remove duplicate code between filters (bug 1301340_). The blueprints was
+deferred.
