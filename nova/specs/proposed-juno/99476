Subject: [PATCH] Dedicate aggregates for specific tenants

in order to optionally exclude instances from being schedule
for deployment in hosts that don't belong to the defined
aggregate(s).

+============================
+Tenants to Aggregate Filter
+============================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/multi-tenancy-isolation-only\
+-aggregates
+
+Extend the "AggregateMultiTenancyIsolation" scheduler filter in order to
+optionally exclude instances from being schedule for deployment in hosts that
+don't belong to the defined aggregate(s).
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+The "AggregateMultiTenancyIsolation" scheduler filter allows the creation of
+instances from defined tenants in specific aggregates.
+If an aggregate has the metadata key "filter_tenant_id" defined with tenant
+ids, (ex: filter_tenant_id=tenant_id1,tenant_id2) only instances from those
+tenants will be scheduled for deployment in the aggregate.
+
+However, it doesn't exclude those instances from being scheduled for
+deployment in other hosts that don't belong to the aggregate. Is not possible
+to exclusively dedicate an aggregate to a set of tenants.
+
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+We propose the introduction of the
+"aggregate_multitenancy_isolation_tenant_exclusive" configuration option for
+the "AggregateMultiTenancyIsolation" scheduler filter. The default value of
+this new configuration option is "false" which preserves the current filter
+behavior. If it's "true" instances from the tenant defined in the aggregate
+metadata "filter_tenant_id" will only be scheduled for deployment to the
+aggregate.
+This will allow the exclusive dedication of an aggregate to a tenant.
+
+Example:
+Aggregate_A => filter_tenant_id = project_a
+Aggregate_B => filter_tenant_id = project_b
+Aggregate_C => filter_tenant_id = project_a
+Aggregate_D
+
+If aggregate_multitenancy_isolation_tenant_exclusive=false (current behavior)
+
+ * Instance_1 from project_a can run in:
+   Aggregate_A, Aggregate_C, Aggregate_D
+ * Instance_2 from project_b can run in:
+   Aggregate_B, Aggregate_D
+ * Instance_3 from project_x can run in:
+   Aggregate_D
+
+If aggregate_multitenancy_isolation_tenant_exclusive=true
+
+ * Instance_1 from project_a can run in:
+   Aggregate_A, Aggregate_C
+ * Instance_2 from project_b can run in:
+   Aggregate_B
+ * Instance_3 from project_x can run in:
+   Aggregate_D

+
+Implement a new filter with this functionality.

+Security impact

+
+Notifications impact

+
+None
+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+
+Current filter behavior is preserved and remains the default.
+New functionality needs to be explicitly enabled by adding the configuration
+option "aggregate_multitenancy_isolation_tenant_exclusive=true".
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+The filter will use the existing DB query
+"aggregate_host_get_by_metadata_key()" if the configuration option
+"aggregate_multitenancy_isolation_tenant_exclusive=true" in order to evalute
+if "filter_tenant_id" is defined in other hosts.
+
+Depending in the deployment size it could have a performance impact.
+Documentation will reflect this.

+Implementation

+
+Work Items
+----------
+
+ * Modify "AggregateMultiTenancyIsolation" to dedicate an aggregate to a
+   tenant if the configuration option
+   "aggregate_multitenancy_isolation_tenant_exclusive" is defined and is
+   "true".
+ * Change the scheduler filter documentation reflecting the new functionality.

+
+Testing
+=======
+
+Additional unit tests:
+ * Set configuration option
+   aggregate_multitenancy_isolation_tenant_exclusive=true.
+   Validate that if the tenant is not in the filter_tenant_id list then the
+   host fails.
+ * Set configuration option
+   aggregate_multitenancy_isolation_tenant_exclusive=true.
+   Validate that if the tenant is in the filter_tenant_id list then the host
+   passes.
+ * Set configuration option
+   aggregate_multitenancy_isolation_tenant_exclusive=true.
+   Validate that if the tenant is in the filter_tenant_id list then all hosts
+   that are not in the aggregate fail.
+ * Set configuration option
+   aggregate_multitenancy_isolation_tenant_exclusive=false.
+   Validate that the host passes for any tenant if it doesn't belong to an
+   aggregate with filter_tenant_id defined.
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+"AggregateMultiTenancyIsolation" documentation will be updated with the new
+feature.
