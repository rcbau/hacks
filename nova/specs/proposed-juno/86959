+==========================================
+Shelf Snapshot Selection
+==========================================
+
+Nova BP:
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/shelf-snapshot-selection
+Novaclient BP:
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/python-novaclient/+spec/shelf-snapshot-selection
+
+Add an option to the existing Shelving API to allow for specifying an existing
+snapshot when shelving a VM.
+
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+The current implementation of the shelving API allows for instances to be
+offloaded while retaining its UUID and networking info. Each time an instance
+is shelved a snapshot of the running instance is created. Some instances such
+as web server pools contain local data that doesnâ€™t change much from day to
+day, and are often created based on the same image. Users should be able shelve
+offload these types of instances without creating additional new snapshots
+provided a snapshot of these instances already exist. This would allow users to
+take an instance offline immediately without waiting for a new snapshot to be
+created. This will also save snapshot storage space.
+
+The following is an example of how this feature might work in the wild: Let's
+say there are 5 instances currently running that are built from the same image.
+After shelving 1 of the instances, a snapshot of the instance would be created.
+If an user wants to shelve the remaining instances, they should be able to
+select an snapshot to associate with the instance when booting up the shelved
+instance, and thus allow the instance to shelve offloaded without creating
+additional snapshots.
+
+Instances taking advantage of this feature would be assumed to be based off the
+same image. To enforce this, we will make use of the instance's image_ref when
+comparing the instance being shelved to the instance of the snapshot that was
+selected.
+
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+Allow operators to specify the name of the snapshot that would be created when
+shelving an instance. This is different from shelve snapshot selection.
+Currently, a default name is assigned to the snapshot that is created when an
+instance is shelved and uses the following naming convention "<instance display
+name>-shelved". The purpose of this is to override the default name of the
+snapshot created and help clarify snapshots that are associated with multiple
+shelved instances, where using the default naming convention would be
+undesirable.
+Example nova command CLI call: nova shelve --name <snapshot name> <instance>
+
+Allow operators to specify an existing snapshot's UUID when shelving an
+instance and then associates the instance's shelved image id with the specified
+snapshot. If the snapshot selected does not exist, shelving will fail and an
+appropriate error message will be provided. To minimize the risk that an
+operator uncarefully selects a wrong snapshot, the instance will be soft
+deleted and allow a reasonable interval to reclaim the instance.s
+Example nova command CLI call: nova shelve --image <image UUID> <instance>
+
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+None.
+
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+Currently, the instance metadata contains a field shelved_image_id that keeps
+track of the shelved image id for the given instance. No additional field will
+be needed in instance object.
+
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+None. The blueprint perserves the existing behaviour of the current POST REST
+API for shelving, and no additional image ref will need to be added.
+Currently, the POST method takes in the following:
+
+* server:
+
+    * name
+    * imageRef
+    * flavorRef
+    * metadata
+    * personality
+
+This sample REST api is found in:
+nova/doc/api_samples/os-shelve/server-post-req.json
+
+The original shelve API creates the image prior to the POST request to shelve
+the instance.
+
+
