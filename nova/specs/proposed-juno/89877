+Problem description
+===================
+
+VirtIO SCSI is a new para-virtualized SCSI controller device for KVM instances.
+It has been designed to replace virtio-blk, increase it's performance and
+improve scalability. The interface is capable of handling multiple block
+devices per virtual SCSI adapter, keeps the standard scsi device naming
+in the guests (e.x /dev/sda) and support SCSI devices passthrough.
+
+Currently, virtio-scsi bus has been supported when booting from glance image
+with property "hw_scsi_mode=virtio-scsi" or cinder volume created by this type
+of image, which is implemented by BP ([1]) in Icehouse.
+
+However, for volumes which were not created from image, we have no method to
+specify using virtio-scsi controller for it.
+
+The aim of this BP as follows:
+
+For bootable volumes which including virito-scsi driver, user can set specific
+metadata for them. When booting from these volumes with "scsi" bus type, use
+virtio-scsi controller instead of the default lsi controller.
+
+The main use case is to improve performance in I/O-intensive applications.
+
+The prior BP [2] proposed by me has already been merged. However, I had a
+misunderstanding about the virito-scsi and volume. In fact, in icehouse, When
+booting from a volume created by glance image with hw_scsi_mode property, the
+volume will also use virito-scsi controller, really sorry for my misleading.
+
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+* Nova retrieve volume's metadata when booting from cinder volume
+
+* Libvirt driver will create the "virtio-scsi" controller if volume has
+  specific metadata, eg. "hw_scsi_model=virtio-scsi"
