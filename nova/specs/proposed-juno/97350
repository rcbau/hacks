Subject: [PATCH] Only allow admins to delete VMs from down compute nodes

Only allow admins to do local deletes to avoid the possibility of
multiple VMs using the same IP.

Change 1: Fix RST syntax errors

Change 2: Fix a couple of typos

+========================================================
+Only allow admins to delete VMs from down compute nodes
+========================================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/only-allow-admins-to-do-local-delete
+
+Currently any user is allowed to do a local delete (delete a VM from a
+compute node which is currently down). This is useful functionality but
+we've seen first hand that there is a potential issue. We locally patch
+the code to restrict local deletes to only admins. Since we find this
+change extremely useful, it may be of benefit to the community.
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+Consider the following scenario.
+
+* A compute node goes down for some unknown cause. All of the VMs currently
+  running on it are unavailable to users.
+
+* The users do 'nova delete' on their VMs. The local delete processing
+  cleans up things and releases the IPs from those VMs back into the pool.
+
+* New VMs are started which may reuse some or all of those IPs.
+
+* Through the valiant efforts of the operations team, the compute node is
+  brought back and all of the VMs hosted on it are restarted.
+
+* We now have multiple VMs with the same IP.
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+The local delete functionality is still extremely important to have in
+order to clean up VMs from down compute nodes. Our proposal (and what
+we do with a local patch) is to only allow admins to use it since they're the
+ones who know if the compute node has a chance of coming back or not.
+
+The exact chance would be to modify nova/compute/api.py before _local_delete
+is called to check if the current user is an admin. If so, go ahead and
+do the local delete as before. If the user is not an admin, then clear
+the current task state and raise an error stating that the delete can't
+happen because the compute node is down, so please contact your local
+administrator.  Note that as part of raising the error, a call to
+QUOTAS.rollback will happen to make sure that the delete quota change does
+not go through.
+
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+We could leave it as it is, but as we've seen, this can be a dangerous
+situation.  We could provide a config setting to retain the old behavior
+for folks who want to go ahead and let their users keep the ability to
+do local deletes.
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+None
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+None
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+
+None
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+
+A new error message will be generated to tell a non-admin user that
+they aren't being allowed to delete their VM because the compute node
+is down and that they should contact their administrator.
+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+
+None
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+None
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+As mentioned above, a new config setting could be added to keep the old
+behavior for folks who like living on the edge. If this config setting is
+added, I strongly recommend that the default setting be to use the new
+more restrictive (and safer) behavior.

+Developer impact

+
+Work Items
+----------
+
+* Modify nova/compute/api.py
+* Modify/write unit tests (if possible)
+
+
+Dependencies
+============
+
+* None
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+* To prevent from breaking any existing local delete tests, we'll need to
+  make sure that the user being used is an admin, or we that the config
+  setting is set to use the old behavior.
+
+* If possible, a new test for non-admin user doing local delete will be
+  written and check that the expected error is returned.
+
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+We may need to add a note to nova delete that it may be rejected by non-admin
+users if the compute node is down.
