+==============================================
+Associate least recently used fixed IP address
+==============================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/associate-lru-fixed-ip-address
+
+In this blueprint, we propose to enhance the fixed IP associate DB API
+functions by having them return the least recently used IP address instead
+of the lowest address, which is likely the most recently used address.
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+End users creating servers have an optimal experience when they can get
+their applications serving in the cloud as immediately as possible. This
+includes networking infrastructure having routes already populated and
+services such as DNS resolving as expected, right away.
+
+Problems can arise if an end user receives a fixed IP address that was
+very recently released by a different user, which is likely in a busy
+and dynamic cloud environment that assigns IP addresses on a first-available
+basis. The IP address associated with the new user's server may have had
+reverse DNS set to point elsewhere or the old user may have had a custom
+hostname configured, requiring DNS to be updated before the new server
+can serve traffic. The problem can be made less likely if IP addresses
+were to be associated on a least recently used basis, instead.
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+We propose a change to the fixed_ip_associate, fixed_ip_associate_pool, and
+floating_ip_fixed_ip_associate functions to add a call e.g.::
+
+  fixed_ip_ref = model_query(context, models.FixedIp, session=session,
+                             read_deleted="no").\
+                             filter(network_or_none).\
+                             filter_by(reserved=False).\
+                             filter_by(instance_uuid=None).\
+                             filter_by(host=None).\
+ +                           order_by('updated_at').\
+                             with_lockmode('update').\
+                             first()
+
+order_by('updated_at') to pick the least recently used fixed IP address and
+return it, instead of the first available, in nova/db/sqlalchemy/api.py
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+Another approach would be a configurable policy for associating fixed IP
+addresses with policies like 'least recently used' and 'first available.'
+This would be a more significant change and involves adding yet another
+configuration flag. It is hoped that the least recently used policy is
+an overall improvement for users creating servers.

+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+Calls of the fixed_ip_associate, fixed_ip_associate_pool, and
+floating_ip_fixed_ip_associate functions will be more costly as the filtered
+rows will be ordered by 'updated_at' before returning the first item.

+Work Items
+----------
+
+ * Add an order_by('updated_at') call to the query of the FixedIp model, right
+   before the with_lockmode('update') call, in the fixed_ip_associate,
+   fixed_ip_associate_pool, and floating_ip_fixed_ip_associate functions in
+   nova/db/sqlalchemy/api.py

+
+Testing
+=======
+
+This change can be tested by adding unit tests to nova/tests/db/test_db_api.py
+which verify that the fixed_ip_associate, fixed_ip_associate_pool, and
+floating_ip_fixed_ip_associate functions return the least recently used/updated
+IP address in the fake DB.
