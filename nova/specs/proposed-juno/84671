+==========================================================
+Add plug-in modules for direct uploads to glance locations
+==========================================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/image-upload-module-plugin
+
+To make image/snapshot upload to the glance more efficient by providing
+a plug-in for other protocols to implement.
+
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+The image needs to download from glance to nova when a VM is launched,
+and the image/snapshot needs to upload from nova to glance when an VM
+image/snapshot is created. By default, HTTP is used to transfer the image
+data, even if it quite huge, even the nova-compute and the glance share
+the same disk, etc. Nova has already implemented a download plug-in
+to allow direct file access to the image in glance and potentially provide
+a chance for other transfer protocols to implement. This proposal will
+introduce an upload plug-in for nova, so that direct file access to the
+VM image/snapshot becomes possible, and other protocols are also possible
+to implement for the image/snapshot upload.
+
+The use cases can be:
+1. If nova-compute and glance share the same disk, it will save a lot
+of time to use the direct access when the image data are huge.
+
+2. If nova-compute does not share the disk with glance and the image
+data are very large, transferring data via other protocols, like ftp,
+bitTorrent, etc, can improve the efficiency. One new protocol may bring in
+a new plug-in by implementing the interface this plug-in provides.
+
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+This blueprint will start the implementation for libvirt. When it
+gets mature, we can considering to generalize it for other hypervisors.
+
+* The nova.conf file needs to have a new configuration,
+  like glance_upload_handler, to indicate the transfer protocol.
+  For example, glance_upload_handler=file means to transfer with direct
+  file access.
+
+* How to implement the update method for the glance api(image_service) needs to
+  change. Take the libvirt driver for instance, the image data is saved into
+  image_file, then call image_service.update(context, image_href, metadata,
+  image_file). We can check if a direct file access is allowed. If so,
+  instead of give the image_file, We can add one parameter,
+  like image_path, to this update method. Within this update method, we do not
+  set image_meta['data'] = data, but set image_meta['data'] = None.
+  In this case, the metadata is created, but the image file is missing for
+  glance. To prepare the image for glance, we can call get_location to retrieve
+  the path for this glance image and directly copy the VM image/snapshot into
+  it. If glance does not provide the location for the empty image data, we can
+  upload a dummy image and then replace it with the real image data afterwards.
+  In summary, we separate the HTTP transfer of image data and image metadata
+  into three steps:
+  1. Update the image status with the metadata, telling glance that the image
+  is reserved first and the image data will be uploaded via other protocols.
+  All the image information can be prepared in this step and the status is
+  set to 'saving'.
+  2. Upload the image data via other protocols.
+  3. When the image is ready in the glance store, update the image status with
+  the metadata to set it to 'active'.
+
+
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+We can make glance actively "take" the image/snapshot as well. Nova upload the
+image metadata with empty image data, glance receives the VM image path, so it
+can directly "take" the VM image via the specified protocol. However, this
+will bring change to glance and glance needs to be enabled with other transfer
+protocols within the code.
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+No changes to the current data model. One new package to be loaded with
+stevedore is added.
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+None.
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+
+None for the direct file access. However, for other protocols, the
+authentication needs to be shared with Keystone. Otherwise we need to maintain
+several security mechanism.
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+
+None.
+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+
+None.
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+I think the image download and upload will have better performance to bypass
+the HTTP.
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+The deployer can configure the image transfer in the way, which is more
+appropriate besides HTTP.
+
+Developer impact
+----------------
+
+The developer will have other choices rather than to put the data into the
+HTTP request, when one needs to transfer data between glance and nova.

+Primary assignee:
+  houshengbo(Vincent Hou)
+
+Other contributors:
+  TBD
+
+Work Items
+----------
+
+
+* Add a new configuration direct_url_upload_schemes for nova.conf.
+
+* Add a new package "upload" nova.image to be loaded with stevedore.
+
+* Implement the direct file access for the image upload.
+
+* Implement the direct upload to swift for the image upload.
+
+* Implement the ftp protocol for the image upload.
+
+* Separate the metadata update and the image upload into two steps.
+
+
+Dependencies
+============
+
+The implementation needs to use glance v2:
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/use-glance-v2-api
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+To test the direct file access, direct access to swift and ftp for
+upload.
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+New documentation need to explain how this upload plug-in is configured.
