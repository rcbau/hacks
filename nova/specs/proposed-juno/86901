Subject: [PATCH] nova-specs: Add sharePolicy element for vnc

From libvirt 1.0.6 version onwards share policy feature is supported
to control the way consoles are accessed by the user. We can use this
share policy for domain's VNC console by adding it to libvirt driver
in nova to manage the opening of number of VNC sessions.

+=====================================================
+Add sharePolicy attribute to graphics element for vnc
+=====================================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/vnc-configurable-share-policy
+
+From libvirt 1.0.6 version onwards share policy feature is supported to control 
+the way consoles are accessed by the user.
+
+Presently it is possible to configure share policy for vnc in 3 different
+ways:-
+1. allow-exclusive, allows clients to ask for exclusive access by dropping
+other connections 
+2. force-share, This is the default value, It allows multiple clients to
+connect to the console in parallel sharing the same session
+3. ignore, welcomes every connection unconditionally
+
+We can make use of this share policy which will allow service provider to
+restrict only single authorized user to connect to the console dropping
+previously connected users automatically if "allow-exclusive" share policy
+is configured.
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+We have reported one bug related to the DoS style attack on noVNC server
+Reference to https://bugs.launchpad.net/nova/+bug/1227575
+
+The above problem can be solved to certain extent if provider uses share
+policy as allow-exclusive as oppose to "force-shared" which is the default
+one as of today.
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+Add a new 'vnc_sharepolicy' parameter to nova.conf, possible options available
+to the administrator are 'allow-exclusive | force-shared | ignore'. By default
+'vnc_sharepolicy' will be set to 'force-shared'.
+
+During loading of compute driver (libvirt), it will check whether the vnc is
+enabled or not. If yes, then it will validate the vnc_sharepolicy parameter
+only when the installed libvirt version is 1.0.6 or above. If the provider has
+configured incorrect value other than the above 3 possible options, then it
+will raise InvalidVNCSharedPolicyOption exception which will lead nova-compute
+service to fail to start.
+
+Implement logic to add 'sharePolicy' attribute to the graphics element for
+type vnc only when the installed libvirt version is 1.0.6 or above.
+
+Examples
+
+<graphics type="vnc" autoport="yes" keymap="en-us" listen="127.0.0.1"
+ sharePolicy="force-shared"/>
+<graphics type="vnc" autoport="yes" keymap="en-us" listen="127.0.0.1"
+ sharePolicy="allow-exclusive"/>
+<graphics type="vnc" autoport="yes" keymap="en-us" listen="127.0.0.1"
+ sharePolicy="ignore"/>
+
+Note: This share policy is only used by vnc and not spice.

+
+- Add a new vnc_sharepolicy new parameter in the nova.conf
+- Depending on the vnc_enabled, validate vnc_sharepolicy parameter and

+Testing
+=======
+
+As this is internal change no need to add tempest tests for the same.
+Only unitests for coverage will do.
