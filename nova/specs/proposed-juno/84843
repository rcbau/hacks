+==================================================
+Nova logs shouldn't have ERRORs or TRACEs in them
+==================================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/clean-logs
+
+Nova logs should be readable, sensible, and contain only errors and
+traces in exceptional situations.
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+During a normal, successful, run of Tempest in the OpenStack gate we
+get a large number of ERRORs and stack traces in the logs. This is for
+passing results, which means the cloud should have been operating
+normally.
+
+Stack traces and errors in the logs under normal conditions make it
+very difficult for operators to actually determine when real issues
+are happening with their OpenStack cloud. We've seen this even as part
+of normal development where people will be tricked in debugging
+OpenStack issues by the ERRORs, when the real issue is masked.
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+We should clean up all the instances of Stack Traces and Errors
+happening under a normal Tempest run. This means addressing the bugs
+that this currently exposes, as well as changing some logging levels
+where we are logging Exceptions at log.exception level that are
+actually expected (and thus should be a log.debug or deleted
+entirely).
+
+See Testing section below for completion criteria.
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+None.
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+None.
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+None.
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+
+None.
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+
+None.
+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+This will change some log messages for clarity. Users that built
+filters around the old error messages will have to adjust their
+filters. As they were probably filtering those messages out, this
+should be minimal.
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+None. (Possibly miniscule, and largely undetectable, boost because of
+not dumping stack traces so much.)
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+None.
+
+Developer impact
+----------------
+
+Developers will have to be more careful about doing arbitrary
+log.exception calls inside Nova code once this is enforcing, and will
+need to be more careful on catching appropriate exceptions for
+expected conditions.

+
+Work Items
+----------
+
+The services should be tackled in this order (consider cleaning of
+each one a work item):
+
+ * n-sched
+ * n-net
+ * n-api
+ * n-cpu
+
+n-sched and n-net are currently the most critical to clean up as they
+are services that surface testing don't hit directly (only indirectly
+through n-api calls). Ensuring that they don't have unexpect behavior
+in dumping stack traces will provide extra verification that those
+services are working as expected.
+
+
+Dependencies
+============
+
+None
+
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+Testing will be accomplished by the tempest check_logs.py script
+currently running in the gate. Once we are confident that we have
+cleaned up a service, we remove that service from the allowed_dirty
+list
+https://github.com/openstack/tempest/blob/master/tools/check_logs.py#L33. After
+that any change which causes there to be a stack trace or error in the
+logs for that service will cause the tempest tests to fail, thus
+blocking the change from merging.
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+There will be a related effort in overall logging standards (to be
+presented as a Juno cross project session) that will need to be
+fleshed out in conjunction with this.
