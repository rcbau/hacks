Subject: [PATCH] EMC: ScaleIO Data Client (SDC) Libvirt Driver

This blueprint proposes to add a libvirt driver for the support of SDC
(ScaleIO Data Client) connected volumes. The addition of SDC support to
libvirt will be leveraged by Nova to attach/detach volumes provided by
products such as EMC ScaleIO and ECS (Elastic Cloud Storage).

+EMC: ScaleIO Data Client (SDC) Libvirt Driver
+=============================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/emc-sdc-libvirt-driver
+
+This blueprint proposes to add a libvirt driver for the support of SDC
+(ScaleIO Data Client) connected volumes. The addition of SDC support to
+libvirt will be leveraged by Nova to attach/detach volumes provided by
+products such as EMC ScaleIO and ECS (Elastic Cloud Storage).
+
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+This blueprint is being submitted for the EMC ECS (Elastic Cloud Storage)
+hyper scale storage infrastructure system. ECS is an appliance that provides
+block, object, and HDFS capabilities natively and combines commodity
+infrastructure with resilient data services. The EMC ECS appliance will
+support block volume services through the ScaleIO block API.
+
+In order to support mounting such block volumes to Nova instances, a
+libvirt driver for ScaleIO block protocol is needed. This blueprint
+proposes to add such a driver to nova.
+
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+A libvirt driver for the ScaleIO protocol used by EMC ECS will be added
+to the nova/virt/libvirt directory.
+
+A section will be added to the list of libvirt volume drivers in the file
+nova/virt/libvirt/volume.py. This will direct volumes of 'volume_driver'
+type 'scaleio' to the correct driver.
+
+A new module called 'scaleio.py' will be introduced. This module will
+contain all the code related to scaleio. There will be minimal changes
+to volume.py.
+
+Refer to the description of ScaleIO technology at:
+http://www.emc.com/storage/scaleio/index.htm
+
+ScaleIO is software-only server based SAN technology. It allows the use
+of commodity disks to deliver affordable and scalable block storage.
+
+To use this driver, the user has to install additional components:
+
+* The SDC Linux driver
+
+* The CLI for ScaleIO
+
+This software can be downloaded from (requires registration):
+https://support.emc.com/products/33925_ScaleIO
+
+Once these dependencies are met, and this driver is installed, nova nodes
+can mount block volumes from the EMC ECS storage system and use them just
+like any other block storage. The SDC Linux driver will direct storage
+traffic over TCP/IP to the right server.
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+None.
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+None.
+
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+None.
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+
+None.
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+
+None.
+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+
+End users will be able to create block volumes from EMC ECS and use them in
+OpenStack.
+
+This change is accompanied by a cinder driver for EMC ECS (a separate
+cinder blueprint).
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+This technology takes advantage of massively parallel I/O processing, with
+all servers participating and sharing I/O loads. By adding servers, you can
+increase capacity and processing power linearly, leveraging fast parallel
+rebuild and rebalance without interruption to I/O.
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+The ScaleIO SDC component must be installed on the OpenStack compute node.
+
+Developer impact
+----------------
+
+None.

+
+Work Items
+----------
+
+* ScaleIO Libvirt driver -- this is already developed
+
+* An entry in the volume.py file
+
+* a filter for scaleio in nova/rootwrap
+
+Dependencies
+============
+
+Cinder blueprint for EMC ECS driver
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/cinder/+spec/emc-ecs-driver
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+The cinder driver will be tested using the cinder acceptance tests. Those
+tests will cover this driver as well. A 3rd party CI testing system
+will be used and its results submitted.
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+This needs to be documented as a new feature.
