Subject: [PATCH] Add support for cinder scheduler hints

When booting an instance with nova boot --block-device i.e.
asking Nova to auto-create storage for a new instance, there
is currently no way for Nova to hint to the Cinder scheduler
how it should go about creating/placing this volumes. This
specification proposes adding support for storing cinder
extra_specs in Nova flavors and passing them to Cinder when
volumes are created.

+Add support for providing cinder scheduler hints when creating volumes

+
+When booting an instance with nova boot --block-device i.e. asking Nova to
+auto-create storage for a new instance, there is currently no way for Nova to
+hint to the Cinder scheduler how it should go about creating/placing this
+volumes. This specification proposes adding support for storing cinder
+extra_specs in Nova flavors and passing them to Cinder when volumes are
+created.
+
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+Cinder supports volume placement based on type, capacity etc using the Cinder
+scheduler but Nova does not support passing any such information to Cinder when
+auto-creating volumes to be attached to a new instance.
+
+The cinderclient supports passing scheduler hints when using the v2 API. By
+adding hints to Nova flavors we can control where Cinder creates storage,
+whether that be physical location, type or indeed any other filter Cinder
+supports.
+
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+The proposed change is envisaged to be reasonably simple. It does, however,
+depend on support in Nova for the Cinder V2 API which is being added as part of
+https://review.openstack.org/43986. Once this lands, the solution proposed here
+would allow Nova to do the following:
+
+* Store Cinder scheduler hints in Nova flavors
+
+* On creation of new instance that requires volumes to be created, pass those
+  hints to Cinder (if v2 API is available/enabled)
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+There are no current alternatives supported in Nova at this time since no such
+volume info is passed to cinder when creating volumes.
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+No change to the current data model will be required since we will be using the
+existing extra_specs container.
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+None.
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+
+None.
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+
+None.
+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+
+None.
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+None.
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+* No change to Nova deployment will be required. For this to work, Cinder v2
+  API must be available and Cinder must support the scheduler hints provided to
+  it.
+
+* If the v2 API is not available/enabled and cinder scheduler hints have been
+  set in a flavor used to boot an instance, an error will be raised.
+
+
+Developer impact
+----------------
+
+None.
+

+Implementation

+Other contributors:
+  None.
+
+Work Items
+----------
+
+* Should be possible to do all this in one patchset.
+
+
+Dependencies
+============
+
+* This change will depend on the Cinder V2 api in order to have any affect as
+  support for passing hints is a cinderclient v2 API operation.
+
+* Requires https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/support-cinderclient-v2
+
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+The primary test case here would be as follows:
+
+1. Configure cinder with > 1 storage backend and volume type.
+2. Create nova flavor with extra-spec container cinder scheduler hint.
+3. Nova boot with --block-device-mapping and --flavor from (2).
+4. Check that instance booted correctly and that auto-created vols are as
+   expected.
+
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+Nova flavor documentation should be updated to reflect this new support for
+cinder scheduler hints in extra_specs.
