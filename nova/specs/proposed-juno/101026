Subject: [PATCH] Blueprint to enable tls mode for spice/vnc console

In this blueprint, we aim to connect to spice/vnc console
of the vm using SSL wrapped socket, if enabled in the configuration.

+Enable tls mode for console access in openstack
+===============================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/console-tls-mode
+
+In this blueprint, we aim to connect to spice/vnc console
+of the vm using SSL wrapped socket, if enabled in the configuration.
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+Both spice and vnc have tls mode configuration available in qemu.conf.
+If it is turned on, additional tls port is opened up for spice/vnc which
+accepts SSL connection.
+
+Currently openstack provides a way to connect to the spice/vnc console of vm
+using nova-spicehtml5proxy or nova-novncproxy.
+
+These proxies connect to the console using non-SSL socket.
+
+There should be a configuration option provided in nova.conf
+called console_tls_mode. If it is turned on,
+then the proxy will attempt to connect to the spice/vnc tls port using SSL.
+
+This will help provide authentication
+and encrypt all connections from proxy to the console.
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+ * Introduce console_tls_mode parameter in nova.conf.
+ * Today, when users request spice/vnc console url,
+   nova-consoleauth stores mapping of token -> console info
+   which includes port at which spice/vnc server is listening.
+   Change: normal port or tlsPort will be stored in the mapping
+   based on what console_tls_mode is configured in nova.conf.
+ * Currently, when users connect to the console url via novncproxy
+   or nova-spicehtml5proxy, nova-consoleauth will validate console port of vm,
+   which user is trying to connect by calling validate_console_port rpcapi.
+   It calls validate_console_port in nova compute manager.
+   Change: nova compute manager will validate normal port or tlsPort
+   based on what console_tls_mode is set in the configuration.
+ * Currently, nova websocketproxy uses non-SSL socket
+   to connect to spice/vnc server.
+   Change: nova websocketproxy will use SSL wrapped socket
+   to connect to spice/vnc server based on what console_tls_mode is configured.

+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+None
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+
+* Mapping corresponding to the token stored in consoleauth
+  will contain tlsPort or normal port based on what
+  console_tls_mode is configured.
+* If console_tls_mode is configured, nova websocket proxy will connect
+  to spice/vnc server using ssl wrapped socket.
+  This will provide authentication and encrypted communication
+  between proxy and compute node.

+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+None
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+* If console_tls_mode is configured, deployer will have to ensure
+  ssl certificates are mentioned in compute driver config file.
+* Also, ensure that tls mode is turned on
+  so that spice/vnc server listens on secure tls port.
