Subject: [PATCH] Speedup listing of domains in libvirt driver

The libvirt driver currently uses the legacy libvirt APIs
for getting lists of domains. These are inefficient and
prone to race conditions, so have been replaced by much
better designed APIs.

+Speedup listing of domains in libvirt driver
+============================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/libvirt-domain-listing-speedup
+
+The libvirt driver currently uses the legacy libvirt APIs for getting
+lists of domains. These are inefficient and prone to race conditions,
+so have been replaced by much better designed APIs.
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+The libvirt driver in Nova currently uses a combination of calls to
+numOfDomains, listDomainsID, numOfDefinedDomains, listDefinedDomains,
+lookupByID and lookupByName to list domains on a host. This is very
+inefficient as it requires O(N) libvirt API calls to list 'N' guests.
+It also has designed in race condition where Nova can loose a guest
+if it transitions from shutoff to running while the list of domains
+is being fetched.
+
+The 0.9.13 version of libvirt introduced a new method listAllDomains
+which can be used to replace all those calls with a single API call,
+thus providing a way to get a list of domains which has constant
+execution time regardless of how many domains there are.
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+A new method 'list_instance_domains' will be introduced that will
+attempt to use the listAllDomains method to fetch the list of domains,
+and fallback to using the old method if it is not supported by the
+libvirt version or the hypervisor driver in use.
+
+Rather than just returning a list of domain IDs, names or UUIDs,
+it will return a list of libvirt.virDomain object instances avoiding
+the need todo separate lookups.
+
+By default it will only return running instances which were originally
+launched by Nova. It can be optionally told to include inactive
+instances, instances launched by other systems (eg libguestfs) or
+the Xen Domain-0 instance.
+
+Everywhere in the libvirt driver which calls list_instances or
+list_instance_ids will then be changed to use this new method, thus
+significantly improving their scalability.
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+Continue to use current APIs, but this is inefficient and prone to
+race conditions, so not at all desirable
+
+Data model impact

+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+It will improve the performance of the libvirt driver when used against
+libvirt >= 0.9.13, particularly when there are lots of instances of the
+host.
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+Deployers are strongly recommended to use libvirt >= 0.9.13 to take
+advantage of the performance improvements.

+
+Work Items
+----------
+
+ - Implement new list_instance_domains method
+ - Write test cases for list_instance_domains
+ - Convert libvirt driver to use list_instance_domains
+
+Dependencies
+============
+
+* Current min libvirt is 0.9.6, but this requires 0.9.13. Fallback
+  code will be provided for use with 0.9.6 versions.
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+The current tempest gate tests should fully exercise the new code
+paths.
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+Recommend deployment of libvirt >= 0.9.13 for best scalability.
