+======================================
+More filters while listing EC2 volumes
+======================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/ec2-volume-filtering
+
+While listing out volumes using EC2's DescribeVolumes API, our implementation
+allows filtering only based on volume IDs, as of now. Amazon's EC2 API has
+support for around a dozen filters. So this blueprint aims for exposing most
+of them through our EC2 API too.
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+We would like our EC2 APIs behave as closely to Amazon's as possible. Making
+the EC2 API support more filters is one step towards this goal. After
+this blueprint gets implemented, EC2 API users will be able to filter volumes
+based on these filters, which currently one cannot. The filters which will be
+implemented will be:
+
+ * create-time
+ * size
+ * snapshot-id
+ * status
+ * volume-id
+ * availability-zone
+ * attachment.attach-time
+ * attachment.delete-on-termination
+ * attachment.device
+ * attachment.instance-id
+ * attachment.status
+
+Three more filters, tag-key, tag-value, volume-type will be implemented, once
+their implementations land in EC2 code.
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+The process of filtering will be separated into two subparts. The first
+part will be filtering the data directly from Cinder. So basically, Cinder
+supports a few filtering options, e.g. filter volumes by metadata. If the
+DescribeVolume API call asks for filtering by metadata, we'll forward that
+request to Cinder, and then Cinder will return back volumes filtered by
+metadata. But if the DescribeVolumes API wants to filter volume additionally
+by using a filter which is not supported by Cinder, we'll not pass this
+filter to Cinder, but in the next subpart, we'll filter it out from the
+output Cinder provided, before returning it back in the response.
+
+A list of filters supported by Cinder, and a list of filters not supported
+by Cinder will be maintained, which the code will use to iterate over for
+filtering. As Cinder starts supporting more and more filters, we'll keep
+moving them from second list to the first. (The 'lists' will just be
+hardcoded inside the DescribeVolumes API code).
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+Can't think of any other method.
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+None
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+DescribeVolumes API will now be able to filter volumes, as opposed to the
+current way of just ignoring all the filters except volume ID.
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+
+None
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+
+None
+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+
+None
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+None
+
+Other deployer impact

+Dependencies
+============
+
+None
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+Tempest tests to test these new filters comprehensively will be added in the
+next iteration.
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+OpenStack's EC2 API doc will need to be updated to show that DescribeVolumes
+now filters volumes too.
