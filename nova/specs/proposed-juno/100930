+==========================================
+Volume Snapshots for Network-Backed Disks
+==========================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/libvirt-volume-snap-network-disk
+
+Nova currently supports creating and deleting snapshots of file-backed
+Cinder volumes via libvirt's snapshot mechanism.  This work extends
+that capability to create and delete snapshots for network-backed disks
+in a similar fashion.
+
+This enables more complete Cinder volume functionality for deployments using
+qemu network-backed volumes through a mechanism like libgfapi.
+
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+Nova does not support creating a snapshot via libvirt for a network-backed
+Cinder volume that is attached to an instance.  Currently, attempting to
+snapshot a Cinder volume configured this way will result in a failed snapshot
+operation.
+
+This is important for deployers who use qemu network-backed storage for Cinder
+volumes.  (Typically for performance reasons.)
+
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+Nova needs to be able to construct a <domainsnapshot> XML entity with
+the required fields to snapshot a network-backed disk via libvirt.
+
+Nova similarly needs to be able to pass in arguments for libvirt's
+blockCommit and blockRebase operations to delete snapshots for network-backed
+disks.  libvirt is adding support for a different style of parameters to the
+blockjob APIs to support this, which allows referencing an existing item in
+the disk snapshot change by index rather than by path name.
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+There is no alternative for deployers wishing to use Nova-assisted snapshots
+of Cinder-backed storage.  Nova must be able to interact with libvirt to
+enable this functionality.
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+None
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+This work is used by the os-assisted-volume-snapshots extension APIs with no
+API-level changes.
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+
+None
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+
+None
+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+
+End-user impact is that Cinder volume snapshots now work when Nova
+is configured to use libgfapi for the GlusterFS Cinder driver.
+(qemu_allowed_storage_drivers=['gluster'])
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+Deleting (merging) a GlusterFS volume snapshot may be more efficient,
+particularly for simultaneous snapshot deletes for different volumes, as
+this work uses qemu direct storage access (via libgfapi) rather than a
+FUSE-mounted file system.
+
+No direct performance impact within Nova itself.
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+This change is relevant when using the Cinder GlusterFS driver and Nova
+is configured with qemu_allowed_storage_drivers=['gluster'].
+
+Developer impact
+----------------
+
+None

+
+Work Items
+----------
+
+* Support for creating a volume snapshot of a network-backed disk
+* Support for deleting a volume snapshot of a network-backed disk
+  - Parse backing chain information from libvirt's domain XML
+  - Pass new-style arguments to blockCommit and blockRebase
+
+Dependencies
+============
+
+* This functionality depends on libvirt changes which are currently targeted
+  for libvirt 1.2.6.
+  - The libvirt capability is detected without using the libvirt version.
+
+* The libvirt changes also require fixes within qemu (targeting 2.1).
+
+* Currently only relevant for GlusterFS Cinder deployments.
+
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+This should be tested via Tempest volume snapshot test cases.  Since it is
+dependent on having a GlusterFS deployment this is not currently tested in
+the gate.
+
+When third-party CI is enabled for the GlusterFS driver within Cinder, it
+should cover this.
+
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+None
