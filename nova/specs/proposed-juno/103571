Subject: [PATCH] Add the docker hypervisor plugin to Nova

As of the Icehouse release, the nova-docker hypervisor plugin was removed since
so many of the Tempest tests were failing. Many of the tests were failing due
to missing APIs in docker and subsequently missing functionality in the plugin.
There has been significant progress implementing those missing features and
fixing various bugs associated with the already existing features. By adding
this plugin back to the Nova source tree, we will enable operators to more
easily manage docker containers via Nova APIs.

The main features, which were missing and are now implemented, causing many of
the Tempest test failures were as follows:

* Pause and Unpause - The API for pausing and unpausing a container was missing
in Docker as well as the hypervisor plugin. The API has now been added to
Docker and is now implemented in the plugin.

* Snapshot - This was primarily broken due to image date not staying
synchronized between Glance and the Docker registry. This has been addressed
in a bug fix to Docker; however, we continue to refactor the the Docker
hypervisor plugin and we'll start pushing Docker images directly into Glance
rather than pushing just image meta-data into Glance.

* Volume Attach and Detach - The API for adding and removing a device to Docker
is missing. There is currently a patch set posted for review, which adds the
capability to attach and detach a host device to a running docker container.
Additionally, the implementation in the hypervisor plugin has been added to
call the Docker API to add/remove a device to/from a container. This will be
merged once the Docker API has been merged.

+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+A detailed description of the problem:
+
+Nova is currently missing the capability of managing Docker containers. The
+Docker hypervisor plugin is useful to OpenStack operators in that it plugs into
+the compute design quite nicely. Implementing container management as a
+hypervisor plugin allows the use of container placement via the scheduler. It
+also allows the implementation of many Nova APIs without having a separate set
+of command line tools to invoke the Nova APIs.
+
+* In order for OpenStack Operators to manage docker containers with the
+  nova-docker hypervisor plugin, it requires that they pull in the source from
+  stackforge and manually configure Nova to use it. By adding it to the
+  directory of hypervisor plugins in Nova, Operators can configure the plugin
+  with ease.
+
+* Adding the driver to the Nova source tree has several benefits. 1) It will
+  expose the driver to continual integration testing. 2) Configuring the plugin
+  to work with Nova becomes trivial. 3) Developers and maintainers of the
+  plugin are continuously aware of Nova changes rather than having to chase
+  after the changes made. 4) The Docker hypervisor plugin becomes part of the
+  integration Nova release.
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+The proposal is that we move the stackforge/nova-docker directory, which
+contains all the code for the docker hypervisor plugin into the
+openstack/nova/nova/virt source directory along side the rest of the hypervisor
+plugins shipped with Nova.
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+Several alternatives exist to work around not having native Docker container
+management in OpenStack. They are as follows:
+
+* Get the nova-docker hypervisor plugin from stackforge and configure Nova to
+  use it.
+
+* Introduce a new container service in OpenStack that is completely independent
+  of Nova APIs and is soley focused on container capabilities.
+
+* Disregard the capabilities granted to a hypervisor plugin and just evolve
+  Docker container management as a Heat project plugin. This would add
+  the capability to create and destroy containers; however, the approach would
+  now allow the the use of granular Nova APIs, nor would it take advantage of
+  using the compute related services such as the scheduler.
+
+* Not include Docker container management in OpenStack at all.
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+None
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+None
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+
+None
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+
+None
+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+
+* The user (Operator) will be able to use the standard Nova APIs and command
+  line tools to manage docker containers.
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+* Containers allow lightweight instances to be started very fast.  They also
+  consume fewer resources on the host machine.
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+* The Docker hypervisor plugin will become easier to configure. The
+  configuration settings already exist in nova.conf to use the Docker
+  hypervisor plugin, the only change here is that the plugin code would be
+  installed with the rest of the hypervisor plugins.
+
+Developer impact
+----------------
+
+* There would be added consideration in future development to support
+  containers.
+
+Implementation
+==============
+
+* The Tempest integration failures need to be resolved, which we are making
+  good progress on
+
+* The stackforge code needs to be placed in the Nova source tree

+
+Work Items
+----------
+
+* Copy the stackforge/nova-docker source code into nova/nova/virt.
+
+* Ensure all tests that logically apply to containers pass.
+
+Dependencies
+============
+
+* The features of the driver are still being worked on and require that several
+  new docker APIs that have been posted as pull requests[2] end up being
+  merged.  This will continue to be that case leading up to the Juno release.
+
+* Although Snapshots are working via synchronizing image meta-data between
+  Glance and the Docker registry, we are actively integrating a change that
+  pushes Docker images directly into Glance. This should help stabilize the
+  Snapshot feature as well as other image operations (creation/removal).
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+* The existing Tempest integration tests cover the APIs that need to work for
+  the Docker driver to be fully compliant.  Some tests may not apply to
+  containers and as such may need to be disabled.  Most of these are simply
+  logical and can be identified easily.
+
+* The Tempest configuration has a number of tests that don't apply to
+  containers that need to be turned off. We are still experimenting with the
+  configuration to make sure we have the right coverage. The settings we are
+  currently turning off are: api_v3, suspend, resize.
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+The docs team would need to add the Docker hypervisor plugin details back to
+the docs, listing the availability of the driver and the module name to set as
+the compute_driver value to have Nova load the driver.
