Subject: [PATCH] HyperV nova driver enhancement to create highly available
 instances

This blueprint creating-hyperv-ha-instances allows creating of highly
available instances in a HyperV hosts that are in a failover cluster.
Highly available virtual machines are defined by the the document
http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc967323.aspx as
'Highly available virtual machines, also known as HAVMs, can easily be
migrated to a different virtual machine host in a failover cluster to provide
continuing service when their current host needs maintenance. If their current
host fails, the HAVMs automatically migrate to a different host in the cluster
through a process known as failover.'

+HyperV nova driver enhancement to create highly available instances

+
+This blueprint creating-hyperv-ha-instances allows creating of highly
+available instances in a HyperV hosts that are in a failover cluster.
+Highly available virtual machines are defined by the the document
+http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc967323.aspx as
+'Highly available virtual machines, also known as HAVMs, can easily be
+migrated to a different virtual machine host in a failover cluster to provide
+continuing service when their current host needs maintenance. If their current
+host fails, the HAVMs automatically migrate to a different host in the cluster
+through a process known as failover.'
+The following whitepaper provides more details.
+Failover Clustering in Windows Server 2008 R2 - Whitepaper
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+Existing HyperV nova driver does not provide the benefits available
+on HyperV hosts configured in a failover cluster and therefore when a
+host in the cluster fails the instance is not available to the user.
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+Add support to configure high availability for an instance in the
+HyperV nova driver. This is done by modifying the instance creation
+steps in the following way
+
+* 1. Create instances on shared storage
+* 2. Configure the instance as highly available
+
+Also, the image cache should also be created on the shared storage
+
+A new boolean config option failover_clustering will be added. When the option
+is set to true, the proposed changes take effect.
+
+The user can override the config on a per instance basis by specifying the
+property hyperv_ha as false
+
+Alternatives for implementation of the proposed change
+
+* 1. Using the config option approach the existing driver behaviour can be
+  modified without adding a new driver deriving from the existing driver.
+  However with this approach, the implementation will have conditional switch
+  since WMI calls to get cluster data are done using a different namespace
+  and classes.
+* 2. Create a new driver that derives from the existing driver. Only override
+  the methods that require changes.
+
+It is proposed to using alternative 1 described above since the changes are
+limited to spawn method.
+
+Configuration requirements that have to be met by the HyperV host for
+HA to work correctly
+(Ref: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc742396.aspx)
+
+Networking - All nodes in the same cluster must use the same name for the
+virtual network that provides external networking for the virtual machines.
+
+Processor - If the nodes in the cluster use different processor versions,
+make sure that the virtual machine is configured for processor compatibility.
+
+Security - All nodes in the cluster must use the same authorization policy.
+
+Storage - Must use shared storage that is supported by both the Failover
+Clustering feature and Hyper-V.
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+* 1. A single driver manages all the hosts in the cluster. The problem
+  with this is the server hosting the nova-compute should always be available.
+  To make this work the nova-compute service must be made a clustered service.
+* 2. The nova-compute runs in a VM that is hosted in a host in the cluster.
+  This VM is configured as a highly available VM. The drawback of this
+  approach is that the remote WMI are slow and therefore will impact the
+  performance of the driver.
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+None
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+None
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+
+None
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+
+None
+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+
+None
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+Instance deployments will have additional WMI calls done to detect the shared
+storage. However since the image cache is on the shared storage, the number of
+downloads from glance is reduced. Earlier each host has its own cache and
+therefore needed to download its own copy.
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+None
+
+Developer impact
+----------------
+
+* This change only impacts the HyperV nova driver. Other drivers will not be
+  impacted due to this change.
+
+Implementation
+==============
+
+The connections are done to the root/MSCluster namespace
+First, the HA resource group of the VMs disk is obtained using the query
+ASSOCIATORS OF {MSCluster_Resource.Name=insert_disk_name_here}
+where ResultRole = GroupComponent
+ResultClass = MSCluster_ResourceGroup
+If its not part of a group a new group can be created using CreateGroup
+
+The resource is created using the CreateResource method
+The resource is brough online using BringOnline method

+Work Items
+----------
+
+* Modify the code the selects the location to spawn an instance to select only
+  shared storage (Cluster Shared Volumes)
+* Enable HA on the instance before starting the instance
+* The image cache must be on shared storage
+
+Dependencies
+============
+
+None
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+The unit tests will be modified to test the branches introduced by the above
+work items
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+A new boolean config option failover_clustering will be added. When the option
+is set to true, the instances are configured as highly available instances.
+
+The user can override the config on a per instance basis by specifying the
+property hyperv_ha as false.
