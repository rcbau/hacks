+==========================================
+Configure TCP Keepalive
+==========================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/configure-tcp-keepalive
+
+In this blueprint we aim to add configuration options to tune TCP keepalive.
+These will be used to enable/disable, and tune, TCP keepalive.
+
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+To avoid socket leaks because of connections being left idle for any reason,the
+nova code has tcp keepalive automatically turned on in places like wsgi.py.
+However, there is no way to configure keepalive parameters.
+
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+nova.conf already has a tcp_keepidle setting. This is meant to be the the
+interval between the last data packet sent (excluding just ACKs) and the first
+keepalive probe; after the connection is marked to need keepalive, this counter
+is not used any further.
+In order to implement this blueprint I propose we specify the following
+configuration options:
+
+ * tcp_keepalive_interval, which is the interval between subsequential keepalive
+   probes
+ * tcp_keepalive_count, which is the number of unacknowledged probes to send before the
+   connection is considered dead
+ * tcp_keepalive_configure, which is the switch to turn on configuration of
+   tcp_keepalive. If this is False, default TCP values would be used.

+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+This change will allow cluster owners to set tcp_keepidle, etc to values
+suitable for their setup, if they choose to do so. At present, this value
+defaults to 10 minutes (600 seconds), which is not necessarily good
+everywhere.
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+There will be three new configuration options in nova.conf. Deployers can
+choose to tune tcp keepalive by turning on the tcp_keepalive_configure
+flag. There is already an option tcp_keepidle for the initial idle window,
+so we only need to add options to set the probe interval and count. Some of
+these options are not supported on OS X, and the code must take this into account.

+Work Items
+----------
+
+* Changes to be made to nova.conf to add more configuration options for
+  tcp_keepalive
+* Changes to code in nova to read in these config values, and handle systems
+  where some socket settings might not be available

+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+There must be documentation to describe what the keepalive parameters mean, when
+and why they should be used, etc.
