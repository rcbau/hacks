Subject: [PATCH] Support function of USB-redirection

There are requirements for USB-redirection function like redirect a USB printer from TC(Think client) to cloud by some kind of protocols like spice,
then user can use printer device in cloud environment

+===================================
+Support function of USB-redirection
+===================================
+
+Include the URL of your launchpad blueprint:
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/usb-redirection
+
+We provide VDI(Virtual Desktop)solution for customers, our customers have
+strong requirements for using USB devices.
+
+The typical use cases and our solutions are described as below:
+
+Customers want to use local USB printers or USB scanners with
+TC(Thin-Client), because remote desktop protocol like ICA have already
+supported USB-redirection, so customers only need to attach USB device to TC,
+the protocol can map USB device to VM.
+
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+Use cases 1:
+
+A end user wants to print some documents in cloud environments, him perform
+the following steps:
+
+1. Create a VM with virtual USB-redirection devices.
+
+2. Use TC with spice client to connect to VM, insert USB printer to TC,
+select printer to redirect to VM in GUI of spice client.
+
+3. User can see printer in VM and use printer to print documents.
+
+Use cases 2:
+
+A end user wants to take a video chat with friends in cloud environments,
+him perform the following steps:
+
+1. Create a VM with virtual USB-redirection devices.
+
+2. Use TC with spice client to connect to VM, insert USB camera to TC,
+select camera to redirect to VM in GUI of spice client.
+
+3. User can see camera in VM and take video chat with friends.
+
+Use cases 3:
+
+A end user wants a on-line shopping, which needs a USB-key for more secure
+payment.
+
+1. Create a VM with virtual USB-redirection devices.
+
+2. Use TC with spice client to connect to VM, insert USB-key to TC, select
+USB-key to redirect to VM in GUI of spice client.
+
+3. User can see USB-key in VM, the security check and payment plugin in
+Browser like IE can use USB-key for authentication.
+
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+1. Add USB-redirection device class in libvirt driver.
+
+Details:
+
+Add 'LibvirtConfigGuestDeviceRedirector' class to libvirt driver. The
+related xml may like:
+
+<redirdev bus='usb' type='spicevmc'>
+
+<address type='usb' bus='1' port='2'/>
+
+</redirdev>
+
+The values of 'bus' and 'type' should be specified by user. The values of
+'address' use constants which user not need to specify.
+
+BTW: BP about echi controller can refer to
+https://review.openstack.org/#/c/88334/
+
+2. If a user wants to use this function, him should firstly set property
+of 'usb_redirector' to image which him uses to create VM, the command
+may like:
+
+glance image-update img1 --property usb_redirector="{'bus': 'usb',
+'type': 'spicevmc'}"
+
+Once libvirt driver finds this property, it creates a
+'LibvirtConfigGuestDeviceRedirector' object, then to_xml function will use
+this object to construct xml of VM, so the xml of VM wil include 'redirdev'.
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+Option2 : Libvirt driver creates a default USB redirdev object for every VM.
+
+Option3 : Compared to option2, uses a nova configuration to control if create
+a default USB redirdev for every VM.

+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+About how to create USB redirdev:
+
+1. If choose option 1 as proposed in 'Proposed change', user should set
+property usb_redirector into image and choose this image to create VM.
+
+2. If choose option 2, user needs to do nothing.
+
+3. If choose option 3, user should change nova configuration to control if
+create a default USB redirdev.
+
+About how to use spice client to do the USB redirection, I have tested in
+CentOS 6.4 with virt-viewer.
+
+1. The system should support x11 and run in x11 mode.
+
+2. Use 'remote-viewer spice://<host>:<port_number>' to connect to VM which
+has USB redirdev.
+
+3. In remote-viewer interface, choose 'File'->'USB device selection' to open
+'Select USB device for redirection' interface, then tick off USB device which
+you want to use. Finally the USB device will appears in your VM.
+
+User may want to install spice-vdagent in guest OS for other functions like
+copy text between spice client and VM. We not go into it here.
