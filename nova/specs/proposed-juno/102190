Subject: [PATCH] Hyper-V: add support for attaching volumes via SMB

Currently, the Hyper-V driver only allows attaching volumes via iSCSI.
The purpose of this blueprint is adding support for attaching volumes
hosted on a SMB share.

+Hyper-V: Support for attaching volumes via SMB
+==============================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/hyper-v-smbfs-volume-support
+
+Currently, the Hyper-V driver allows attaching volumes only via iSCSI. The
+purpose of this blueprint is adding support for attaching volumes hosted on
+a SMB share.
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+For the moment, there are drivers which support distributed file systems such
+as Gluster or NFS as volume backends. SMB is another widely used protocol,
+especially in the Microsoft world.
+
+Its simplicity along with the big improvements that were introduced in SMB 3
+make this type of volume backend a very good alternative.
+
+SMB 3 brings features such as transparent failover, multichanneling using
+multiple NICs, encrypted communication, and RDMA. Note that in order
+to use live migration, SMB 3 is required.
+
+This feature will be backwards compatible, supporting older versions of SMB
+for simple tasks. It will support using any type of SMB share, including:
+
+	- from Scale-Out file servers to basic Windows shares;
+
+	- Linux SMB shares using Samba;
+
+	- vendor specific hardware exporting SMB shares.
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+A new volume driver will be added in order to support attaching volumes
+hosted on SMB shares. The Hyper-V driver will be able to choose between the
+volume drivers using the volume type stored in the connection info.
+
+The SMB volume driver will mount the share on which a volume is hosted using
+credentials specified in the volume connection info, then attach the volume
+to a VM using its UNC path. This way, the Hyper-V driver will be able to
+attach vhd or vhdx images hosted on SMB shares.

+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+None
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+None
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+
+The credentials recieved in the volume connection_info will be used in
+order to mount the according SMB share.
+
+Note that the Hyper-V VMMS user account needs access to the remote image file
+in order to be able to attach it to instances. As a best practice, the Cinder
+and Nova nodes should be part of the same AD domain, using AD credentials
+and giving the required permissions to Hyper-V VMMS.
+
+Notifications impact

+
+Work Items
+----------
+
+Add SMB Volume driver.
+
+Adapt Hyper-V Driver in order to be able to use multiple volume drivers
+according to volume types.
+
+Adapt existing volume related operations such as lookups in order to support
+disk resources stored on SMB shares.
+
+Dependencies
+============
+
+None
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+This feature should be tested along with the upcoming SMB Cinder driver.
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+Using the SMB backend will be documented.
