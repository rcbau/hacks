Subject: [PATCH] Better Support for Multiple Networks

Since nova-network is staying around, it needs a few updates for
multiple networks. There are various settings that are automatically
determined or set via flags, that should be explicitly set per network.
This spec is about adding a few options to the networks table and
converting the network manager and linux_net code to support multiple
networks.

+Better Support for Multiple Networks in nova-network
+====================================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/better-support-for-multiple-networks
+
+Since nova-network is staying around, it needs a few updates for multiple
+networks. There are various settings that are automatically determined or set
+via flags, that should be explicitly set per network. This spec is about adding
+a few options to the networks table and converting the network manager and
+linux_net code to support multiple networks.
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+Currently it is impossible to have multiple networks with different mtu
+settings or to have some networks that share ips or have external gateways and
+others that do not. If you have a single network it is possible to specify a
+different (external) gateway for that network by adding a custom dnsmasq.conf,
+but this breaks down when you have multiple networks.
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+This change proposes adding four fields to the networks table:
+
+ * mtu
+ * dhcp_server
+ * enable_dhcp
+ * share_address
+
+Each of the new fields will be used in place of existing config options or
+automatic value interpretation. The defaults for these options will mean there
+is no difference to users if they are not specified.
+
+It will also modify network create to allow these fields to be modified. An api
+extension will be added so one can determine if extra network fields are
+available.
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+Supporting this functionality without changing the data model would require
+some pretty complex config options. For example mtu could be a list of network
+names and mtus, but this is extremely unweildy.
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+This adds four new fields to the network model. The fallback for these fields
+will use the existing config options and defaults. These config options will be
+marked deprecated but will still work by default.
+
+The four new fields will be added to the object model, and they will be cut out
+for older versions.
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+The current network create api allows extra values to be passed in and they are
+silently ignored. In order to provide information about whether the new fields
+are supported, a dummy api extension will be created and the extra fields will
+only be accepted/returned if the api extension is enabled.
+
+The json for a network create call would currently look like::
+
+    {
+        "network": {
+            "label": "new net 111",
+            "cidr": "10.20.105.0/24",
+            ...
+        }
+    }
+
+With the new fields it would support::
+
+    {
+        "network": {
+            "label": "new net 111",
+            "cidr": "10.20.105.0/24"
+            "mtu": 9000,
+            "enable_dhcp": "true",
+            "dhcp_server": "10.20.105.2",
+            "share_address": true,
+            ...
+        }
+    }
+
+These fields will also be returned in the show command::
+
+    {
+        "network": {
+            "bridge": "br100",
+            "bridge_interface": "eth0",
+            "broadcast": "10.0.0.7",
+            "cidr": "10.0.0.0/29",

+            "created_at": "2011-08-15T06:19:19.387525",
+            "deleted": false,

+            "gateway": "10.0.0.1",
+            "gateway_v6": null,
+            "host": "nsokolov-desktop",
+            "id": "20c8acc0-f747-4d71-a389-46d078ebf047",
+            "injected": false,
+            "label": "mynet_0",
+            "multi_host": false,
+            "netmask": "255.255.255.248",
+            "netmask_v6": null,

+            "project_id": "1234",
+            "rxtx_base": null,
+            "updated_at": "2011-08-16T09:26:13.048257",

+            "dhcp_server": "10.20.105.2",
+            "enable_dhcp": true,
+            "share_address": true
+        }
+    }
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+
+This change doesn't have any security impact.
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+
+This change doesn't impact notifications.
+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+
+This change will also include a modification to python-novaclient network
+create to allow users to create networks specifying the additional fields.
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+The performance impact of this change is negligible.
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+Deployers should start using the network fields in place of the config options,
+but there is no requirement for them to move right away.
+
+Developer impact
+----------------
+
+This change should not affect developers.

+
+Testing
+=======
+
+There are currently no tempest tests for the create network call. A test for
+create network including the new fields  will be added.  The internal
+modifications will be covered by unit tests.
+
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+The new additions to the network create call need to be documented.
