Subject: [PATCH] Nova using ephemeral storage with cinder.

As a cloud provider I would like to be able to serve nova's
ephemeral storage by cinder.

+Nova using ephemeral storage with cinder
+===========================================
+

+
+As a cloud provider I would like to be able to serve nova's ephemeral storage
+by cinder. For certain deployment scenarios this would ease management and 
+maintenance effort when one entity manages all storage related items.
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+As a cloud provider I would like to manage all the storage related activities
+through one entity: cinder.
+A lot of people want to ease management and maintenance of their virtual 
+machines and their storage.
+With cinder serving the needs for nova's ephemeral storage, glance image 
+storage and cinder block storage there would be one entity to manage all 
+the storage related items (also for blade systems without local storage). 
+Things like live-migration could be made easier.
+As there is development ongoing in glance to use cinder as image backend,
+we have to address the usage in nova to use ephemeral storage with cinder
+as backend in this blueprint.
+When talking about ephemeral, it has to be noted that the rootfs is also
+ephemeral.
+
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+Proposal
+- VM boot requested by the tenant
+- Nova tries to find an "ephemeral" volume for the VM
+- Today nova will use the local disk.
+This blueprint suggests to change nova to be able to use
+a cinder volume as ephemeral storage instead of local disk.
+
+See Implementation for more details.
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+The current block device mapping implementation can be used which is
+not that easy to use than the proposed solution here.

+
+Implementation
+==============
+Introduce a new configuration parameter force_ephemeral_on_cinder
+in nova.conf.
+When force_ephemeral_on_cinder=True, no ephemeral storage should be used.
+This is checked by nova before creating ephemeral storage, instead
+nova sends request to cinder to create a bootable volume in the size of the
+root disk size of the flavor. When the flavor defines a secondary ephemeral
+data disk, a second volume in the size of the second ephemral data disk shall
+be created by nova sending this request to cinder and shall be attached to 
+the virtual machine after it has booted.
