+Add support for Glance v2 API
+==============================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/use-glance-v2-api
+
+This spec adds the ability support for Nova to use the Glance v2 API, and start
+the deprecation period for the support of the Glance v1 API.
+
+While parts of Nova already use the Glance v2 API, this is about making the
+dependency on Glance v1 API optional, so it can be removed completely in a
+future release.
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+Glance relegated v1 from CURRENT to SUPPORTED status in Kilo. Currently Nova
+requires access to the Glance v1 API. Glance would like to deprecate that API,
+so to help that effort Nova should stop using Glance v1 API.
+
+To allow for a smooth upgrade, we need to ensure Mitaka supports using both
+Glance v1 and Glance v2, to give deployers time to ensure they have Glance v2
+deployed in a way that can be used by Nova.
+
+While some areas of Nova already make use of Glance v2, there are many areas of
+Nova that still have a hard dependency on Glance v1. The key areas that still
+use Glance v1 include:
+
+* Nova's Image API, that is effectively just a proxy of Glance's v1 API
+
+* Virt driver specific download of images and upload of images
+
+* CRUD operations on image metadata
+
+* Creating and deleting snapshots in common code.
+
+Before we can stop Nova requiring Glance v1 and fully deprecate the requirement
+for Glance v1, we need to remove all the above uses of Glance v1.
+
+Note we must keep compatibility for Glance v1 and Glance v2 to allow for a
+smooth upgrade between releases.
+
+Note the current version of Glance v2 does not provide an efficient way to
+implement the changes_since parameter that is supported by the current Nova
+Images API. However, Glance have plans to fix that:
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/glance/+spec/v2-additional-filtering
+
+Use Cases
+----------
+
+Currently, Nova deployers are forced to deploy both Glance v1 and Glance
+v2. This is because Nova currently requires Glance v1, but only Glance v2 is
+considered safe to be exposed publicly to End Users.
+
+It is assumed that Nova's lack of support for Glance v2 is causing confusion
+that is holding people back from deploying Glance v2. This in turn is causing
+some problems for the DefCore effort.
+
+
+Project Priority
+-----------------
+
+None
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+The number of changes would be minimal to avoid destabilizing. A thorough
+refactor can be done in a follow up spec(s).
+
+The main bulk of the work is ensuring the Nova Image API contract is maintained
+while talking to either Glance v1 API or Glance v2 API. This will require the
+current Nova Image seam to be capable of talking to both version of the API at
+the same time. Glance API's version discoverability will be used to determine
+whether the v2 of the API is deployed or not. If so, it'll be prefered over v1.
+
+The second part is looking at other areas in Nova's Glance related
+modules that don't work with the Glance v2 API.
+
+Once that is completed, there are still some virt driver specific Glance client
+code, but that will be considered a stretch goal, and should not block the
+general deprecation of Glance v1 API support.
+
+The virt drivers that don't support Glance v2 should fallback to
+v1. Eventually, all drivers should support v2 and Glance's v1 should be turned
+off by default. The expected deadline for this switch is N.
+
+This spec doesn't intend to change the value of the existing Nova
+configurations for Glance - which include the version in the URL - but rather
+notify the deployer that the new expected value has changed and the
+configuration file should be updated. During the Mitaka cycle, we can strip the
+verion from the URL to discover what versions of the API are deployed and favor
+2 over 1 when possible.
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+Ideally glanceclient should work as a seam for both Cinder and Nova to use to
+upload and download images, with a stable API. But this is not currently the
+case, and we have waited too long for this support to delay this work any
+further. However, it is assumed that this will exist in the future to avoid
+getting to these situation again.
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+None.
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+There will be no impact on the REST API contract. The Nova Image API will
+continue to proxy requests to Glance v1 until the work to bring back
+changes_since is complete.
+
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+
+None.
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+
+None.
+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+
+None.
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+None.
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+The deployers should need to be aware that it's possible some virt drivers may
+not support Glance v2 yet. The details of this will be clearly documented in
+the release notes and proper warnings will be logged.
+
+These drivers will explicitly request v1 to be deployed instead of relying
+entirely on version discoverability
+
+Developer impact
+----------------
+
+None.

+
+Work Items
+----------
+
+* Move `nova.image` to be backed by either Glance v1 or Glance v2, defaulting
+  to Glance v2. Do this by refactoring the models that consume the images API
+  to support Glance v1 and Glance v2.
+
+* Ensure the rest of the code base can use the existing image code to talk to
+  either Glance v1 or Glance v2, again defaulting to Glance v2 when possible.
+
+* Ensure all the virt drivers either support Glance v2 or fallback to v1.
+
+* Add a deprecation warning in the logs if users run with Glance v1.
+
+Dependencies
+============
+
+Full support for Glance v2 by the Nova Image API is dependent on:
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/glance/+spec/v2-additional-filtering
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+The existing tempest tests will validate the Glance v2 API support, as the
+default will move to Glance v2.
+
+However, we should also make sure one of the gate jobs still tests the Glance
+v1 only to avoid breaking existing deployments.
+
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+* Glance API version configuration option needs to be documented
+* Release Notes should note the partial deprecation of Glance v1 support
+* Release Note should warn about any virt drivers that are unable to run with
+  Glance v2.
