Subject: [PATCH] Snapshot failure makes instance unusable

Not every private cloud deployment has the facility to opt for remote
storage. When using local storage, if the hypervisor does not have
enough storage space to store the snapshot, the instance might go into
unusable state. Protecting user data is one of the most important aspect
in providing better user experience.

+Instance unusable if instance snapshot fails due to in-sufficient storage space
+===============================================================================

+instance-snapshot-vm-unusable-insufficient-storage-space>`_
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+Creating an instance snapshot is a two step process :-
+  1. Nova with the help of underlying virtualization technology creates the
+     snapshot.
+  2. Glance uploads the created instance snapshot in step #1 to glance store.
+
+If step #1 fails, lets say, due to in-sufficient storage space, nova fails to
+create the snapshot. The instance is also put in "PAUSED" state. This makes the
+instance unusable for the user, without admin intervention.  The focus of this
+spec will be step #1. Step #2 covering Glance upload of the instance snapshot
+and error handling is handled in a `separate spec
+<https://blueprints.launchpad.net/glance/+spec/glance-quota-enhancements>`
+
+Not every deployment stores instance data on a remote storage. Snapshots are
+the only way for users to backup their instances. Hence this problem is
+critical since it makes the instance unusable, without providing a way for the
+user to recover the instance. This problem is present in every release of
+OpenStack till date.  The spec aims to solve the problem and enhance User
+experience by displaying proper message if instance snapshot cannot be created
+at that particular moment preventing any data loss if not done so.
+
+Use Cases
+---------
+
+Bob, is an admin of the private cloud and Alex is the user of the cloud.  Alex
+creates the instances and uses them for his daily development, testing,
+production work. Alex wants to protect his data and decides to create an
+instance snapshot. Alex, just being a consumer of the private cloud is un-aware
+of the disk consumption of the particular Hypervisor on which his VM instance
+is residing. It happens that there is not enough free space on the Hypervisor
+where Alex's VM instance resides. Alex issues nova image-create to create the
+snapshot. The command return successfully and Alex believes that the snapshot
+will be created and he will be able to see the snapshot. In fact the snapshot
+doesn't get created and Alex ends up loosing his VM instance as the VM instance
+goes into "PAUSED" state. Its not straighforward to recover the VM instance.
+
+The user whose intention was to protect data ends up with an unusable instance.
+This could potentially result in data loss.

+Proposed change
+===============
+
+1. The proposed change is to add a RPC `validate_task` and should be executed
+   before each task which plans to update/write to the disk. Example of such
+   tasks can be snapshot, backups, instance creation, etc.
+
+2. The `validate_task` RPC will help to validate whether there is enough free
+   space on the respective target where the update/write is to be targetted at.
+
+3. For example when a user wants to create an instance snapshot,
+   `snapshot_instance` RPC is invoked. This gets the snapshot location, does
+   the intermediate image conversion from RAW to QCOW2(say), and then calls
+   glance to store the snapshot. This RPC call does not take into account
+   whether the path pointed by CONF.snapshots_directory has enough storage
+   space. Even the disk utility methods exposed are centered around
+   CONF.instance_path and the parameters reported by the resource tracker are
+   more centered around the CONF.instance_path. But the
+   CONF.snapshots_directory need not be on the same partition, under same mount
+   point or same disk.
+
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+Resource Tracker depends on compute utility modules to fetch the usage and
+availability details, which eventually gets populated to the Nova database via
+the Nova Conductor layer. But the calculations of Resource Tracker revolve
+around CONF.instance_path and those values can't be relied upon if
+CONF.instance_path and CONF.snapshots_directory are not under same mount point,
+different disks, different parititions etc.
