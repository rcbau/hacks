Subject: [PATCH] Add support to boot from UEFI images

Libvirt 1.2.8 version has included support to boot UEFI instances using OVMF,
therefore nova compute needs to be able to boot instances using UEFI images.

+Boot From UEFI image
+==========================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/boot-from-uefi
+
+OpenStack Liberty Release does not enable UEFI images to be booted via the
+Nova compute libvirt driver. This is a problem because there is a slow but
+stedy trend for OSes to move to the UEFI format and in some cases to make the
+UEFI format their only format. Microsoft Windows is moving in this direction
+and Clear Linux is already in this category. Given this, we propose enabling
+UEFI boot with the libvirt driver. Additionally, we propose using the well
+tested and battle hardened Open Virtual Machine Firmware (OVMF) as the VM
+firmware for x86_64.
+
+Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) is a standard firmware designed
+to replace BIOS, VM boot is supported by libvirt since version 1.2.8.
+
+OVMF is a port of Intel's tianocore firmware to qemu virtual machine, in other
+words this project enables UEFI support for Virtual Machines.
+
+Problem description
+===================
+Platform vendors have been increasingly adopting UEFI for the platform firmware
+over traditional BIOS. This, in part, is leading to OS vendors also shifting to
+support or provide UEFI images. However, as adoption of UEFI for OS images
+increases, it has become apparent that OpenStack through its Nova compute
+Libvirt driver, does not support UEFI image boot. This is problematic and needs
+to be resolved.
+
+Use Cases
+----------
+1. User wants to launch a VM using a specific flavor and their own UEFI image.
+In this case the user needs to be able to tell Nova everything that is needed
+to launch the desired VM. The only additional information that should be
+required is an extra spec indicating that the specified image is a UEFI image
+and needs to be treated as such. Being treated as such means that the Nova
+scheduler would filter the possible compute hosts based on the extra spec, pass
+the extra spec to the libvirt driver which would then use this information to
+locate and use the correct firmware for VM boot.
+
+2. User has a UEFI image and wants to make it available in Glance for general
+use. In this case we want the user to be able to upload the image to Glance in
+the same way they do today. However, we will need to enable Glance to recognize
+that the image being uploaded is UEFI or not and add the appropriate extra spec
+when it is a UEFI image.
+
+3. User wants to launch a VM based on a specific flavor and UEFI image. The
+image is in Glance. Given use cases 1 and 2 have been implemented, the user
+needs not do anything special to launch a VM based on an image is Glance (UEFI
+or not).
+
+Project Priority
+-----------------
+
+None
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+We offer a solution for including UEFI images in OpenStack as first class
+citizens. Enabling their recognition on upload to Glance through to their being
+scheduled by Nova and launched onto a Nova compute host via the libvirt driver.
+For x86_64 images we will use the battle hardened OVMF (Open Virtual Machine
+Firmware) a sub-project of Intel's EFI Development Kit II (edk2), which enables
+UEFI support for Ia32 and X64 Virtual Machines. Other architecture should also
+be supported.
+
+Add missing elements when generating XML definition in libvirt driver to
+support OVMF firmware. Add also a new metadata value to specify firmware used
+per defined image.
+
+This way, when operator uploads an UEFI bootable image he/she can update the
+metadata value specifying the path of firmware used to boot the image.
+
+When user launch a VM from an UEFI image, the XML generated would include
+proper values to use firmware previously defined by the operator.
+
+Posting to get preliminary feedback on the scope of this spec.
