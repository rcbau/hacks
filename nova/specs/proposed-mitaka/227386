Subject: [PATCH] Propose VMware limits, reservation and shares

The aim is to support the blueprint vmware-limits-mitaka

The BP was partially implemented in Liberty.

Still in review:
1. VIF limits
2. Flavor updates
3. Image properties

+==========================================
+VMware Limits, Shares and Reservations
+==========================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/vmware-limits-mitaka
+
+VMware Virtual Center provides options to specify limits, reservations and
+shares for CPU, memory, disks and network adapters.
+
+In the Juno cycle support for CPU limits, reservation and shares was added.
+This blueprint proposes a way of supporting memory, disk and network
+limits, reservations and shares.
+
+For limits the utlization will not exceed the limit. Reservations will be
+guaranteed for the instance. Shares are used to determine relative allocation
+between resource consumers. In general, a consumer with more shares gets
+proportionally more of the resource, subject to certain other constraints.
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+The VMware driver is only able to support CPU limits. Providing admins the
+ability to provide limits, reservation and shares for memory, disks and
+network adapters will be a very useful tool for providing QoS to tenants.
+
+Use Cases
+----------
+
+* This will enable a cloud provider to provide SLA's to customers
+
+* It will allow tenants to be guaranteed performance
+
+Project Priority
+-----------------
+
+None
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+Due to the different models for different drivers and the API's in which
+the backends expose we are unable to leverage the same existings flavor
+extra specs.
+
+For example for devices libvirt makes use of: 'hw_rng:rate_bytes',
+'hw_rng:rate_period'.
+
+In addition to this there are the following disk I/O options are:
+
+'disk_read_bytes_sec', 'disk_read_iops_sec', 'disk_write_bytes_sec',
+'disk_write_iops_sec', 'disk_total_bytes_sec', and
+'disk_total_iops_sec'.
+
+For bandwidth limitations there is the 'rxtx_factor'. This will not enable
+us to provide the limits, reservations and shares for vifs. This is used in
+some bases to pass the information through to Neutron so that the backend
+network can do the limitations. The following extra_specs can be configured
+for bandwidth I/O for vifs:
+
+'vif_inbound_average', 'vif_inbound_burst', 'vif_inbound_peak',
+'vif_outbound_average', 'vif_outbound_burst' and 'vif_outbound_peak'.
+
+None of the above of possible for the VMware driver due to VC API's. The
+following additions below are proposed:
+
+Limits, reservations and shares will be exposed for the following:
+
+* memory
+
+* disks
+
+* network adapters
+
+The flavor extra specs for quotas has been extended to support:
+
+* quota:memory_limit - The memory utilization of a virtual machine will not
+  exceed this limit, even if there are available resources. This is
+  typically used to ensure a consistent performance of virtual machines
+  independent of available resources. Units are MB.
+
+* quota:memory_reservation - guaranteed minimum reservation (MB)
+
+* quota:memory_shares_level - the allocation level. This can be 'custom',
+  'high' 'normal' or 'low'.
+
+* quota:memory_shares_share - in the event that 'custom' is used, this is
+  the number of shares.
+
+* quota:disk_io_limit - The I/O utilization of a virtual machine will not
+  exceed this limit. The unit is number of I/O per second.
+
+* quota:disk_io_reservation - Reservation control is used to provide guaranteed
+  allocation in terms of IOPS
+
+* quota:disk_io_shares_level - the allocation level. This can be 'custom',
+  'high' 'normal' or 'low'.
+
+* quota:disk_io_shares_share - in the event that 'custom' is used, this is
+  the number of shares.
+
+* quota:vif_limit - The bandwidth limit for the virtual network adapter.
+  The utilization of the virtual network adapter will not exceed this limit,
+  even if there are available resources. Units in Mbits/sec.
+
+* quota:vif_reservation - Amount of network bandwidth that is guaranteed to
+  the virtual network adapter. If utilization is less than reservation, the
+  resource can be used by other virtual network adapters. Reservation is not
+  allowed to exceed the value of limit if limit is set. Units in Mbits/sec.
+
+* quota:vif_shares_level - the allocation level. This can be 'custom',
+  'high' 'normal' or 'low'.
+
+* quota:vif_shares_share - in the event that 'custom' is used, this is the
+  number of shares.
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+The alternative is to create an abstract user concept that could help hide
+the details and of the difference from end users, and isolate the differences
+to just the admin users.
+
+This is really out of the scope of what is proposed and will take a huge
+cross driver effort. This will not only be relevant for flavors but maybe for
+images too.
