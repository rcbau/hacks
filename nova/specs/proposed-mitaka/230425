+==========================================
+VMware: Expand Support for Opaque Networks
+==========================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/vmware-expand-opaque-support
+
+An opaque network was introduced in the vSphere API in version 5.5. This is
+a network that is managed by a control plane outside of vSphere. The identifier
+and name of this network is made know to vSphere so that a host and virtual
+machine ethernet device can be connected to them.
+
+The initial code was added to support the NSX-MH (multi hypervisor) Neutron
+plugin. This was in commit 2d7520264a4610068630d7664eeff70fb5e8c681. That
+support would require the configuration of a global integration bridge and
+ensuring that the network was connected to that bridge.
+
+In the Liberty cycle support for the next generation Neutron plugin, NSXv3,
+was added. The compute integration for this plugin needs to make use of the
+Neutron network ID and not the integration brdige.
+
+This spec will deal with that integration.
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+This spec will deal with the configuration of the Opaque network for the NSXv3
+Neutron driver.
+
+Use Cases
+----------
+
+This is required for the NSXv3 plugin. Without it Nova will be unable to attach
+a ethernet device to a virtual machine.
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+The change is self contained within the VMware driver code and just related to
+how the ethernet device backing is configured. This is only when the Neutron
+virtual port is of the type 'ovs'. When the type is 'ovs' there are two
+different flows:
+
+* If the configuration flag 'integration_bridge' is set. This is for the
+  NSX-MH plugin. This requires that the backing type opaqueNetworkId be set
+  as the 'integration_bridge'; the backing type opaqueNetworkType be set as
+  'opaque'.
+
+* If the flag is not set then this is the the NSXv3 plugin. This requires that
+  the backing value opaqueNetworkId be set as the neutron network UUID; the
+  backing type opaqueNetworkType will have value 'nsx.LogicalSwitch'; and the
+  backing externalId  has the the neutron port UUID.

+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+The NSXv3 installation will be greenfield. So there is no upgrade impact.
+Due to the fact that the NSX-MH will be deprecated and replaced by the NSXv3
+we will set the default 'integration_bridge' value as None. This means that
+a user running the existing NSX-MH will need to make sure that this value
+is set. This is something that will be clearly documented.

+
+Work Items
+----------
+
+The code has been implemented in the Liberty cycle and can be seen at
+https://review.openstack.org/#/c/165750/.
+
+
+Dependencies
+============
+
+This code depends on the Neutron driver NSXv3 added in the Liberty cycle.
+
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+The code is tested as part of the Neutron CI testing.
+
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+A deployer is only affected by this.
