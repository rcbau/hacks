+inheritable admin image properties
+==========================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/inheritable-admin-image-properties
+
+Make some image properties inheritable when snapshotting or shelving an
+instance, even though the user does not have the permission to create them.
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+An image in glance can have custom properties with CRUD rules depending on
+user-roles.
+When snapshotting or shelving an instance, nova creates a new image in glance
+using the user credentials. If the user does not have the permission to create
+one of the custom properties he is not able to create an image, thus he is not
+able to snapshot or shelve the instance.
+
+Use Cases
+----------
+
+A cloud-administrator wants to store license-cost properties on a per-image
+basis (like how much to charge per hour per cpu). This property can be
+protected by role, but a cloud owner will want this property to be
+automatically inherited to child images.
+
+Another use case would be an administrator who wants to make operations on
+instances depending on image properties. For example tagging Windows instances
+so they are run on a specific aggregate. The administrator wants this tag to be
+inherited automatically, but he does not want the user to be able to change
+this property.
+
+Project Priority
+-----------------
+
+None
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+We propose to create the option "inheritable_admin_image_properties" containing
+a list of inheritable custom properties.
+After creation of the image from snapshotting or shelving the instance, those
+properties will be set by nova using its admin credentials.
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+An alternative would be to create this functionality in glance. However we do
+not think it is the way to do it since glance behaves like a simple object
+store.
+Inheritance is defined by custom properties which leads us back to our problem.
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+None
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+None
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+
+This change requires elevated privilege.
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+
+None
+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+
+None
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+With the option enabled there should be a performance impact as the request
+will get a new token for elevated authentication.
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+A new option will be available in the config file of nova :
+inheritable_admin_image_properties
+
+Developer impact
