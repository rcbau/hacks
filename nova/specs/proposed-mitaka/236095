Subject: [PATCH] PowerVM Driver Integration into Nova

The IBM PowerVM driver has been developed in the StackForge over the
past year.  As it has matured, this proposal seeks to integrate it into
the OpenStack Nova tree.

+PowerVM Driver from StackForge to Nova
+======================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/powervm-nova-compute-driver
+
+The IBM PowerVM hypervisor provides virtualization on the POWER hardware
+platform. IT administrators of PowerVM can achieve significant benefits by
+being able to include PowerVM in a standard OpenStack management environment.
+This driver (along with a Neutron ML2 compatible agent and Ceilometer agent)
+provides the capability for operators of PowerVM to manage directly through
+OpenStack.
+
+The purpose of this blue print is to take the open source `nova-powervm`_
+driver and integrate it into core Nova.
+
+.. _nova-powervm: https://launchpad.net/nova-powervm
+
+It is important to note that PowerVM is a separate hypervisor from KVM on
+POWER.  Both are independent hypervisors, each with their own unique benefits.
+Much like x86 supports various hypervisors, this is also an important aspect
+for POWER.  KVM for POWER is already supported by the existing libvirt
+driver.  This provides choice for operators to determine which hypervisor best
+fits the needs of their users and workload.
+
+
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+The PowerVM driver meets the following criteria:
+
+* Built within the community
+
+* Standardized on OpenStack's management model
+
+* Utilizes automated functional and unit tests
+
+* Enables management of PowerVM systems through the OpenStack APIs
+
+* Allows attachment of Cinder volumes utilizing supported protocols
+
+This driver has been developed in StackForge over the past year with input
+from the community (Note: as of Oct 19th, it was moved to the
+openstack/nova-powervm namespace).
+
+Two central tenets around development of this driver are alignment with
+OpenStack architecture and ongoing community commitment. The IBM PowerVM
+NovaLink support enables the OpenStack agents to drive virtualization commands
+on the system, which aligns with the standard OpenStack compute driver model.
+
+The nova-powervm driver is currently used by products such as IBM's Power
+Virtualization Center (PowerVC). The next step is to integrate this driver
+into the core Nova project.
+
+It should also be noted that there was a previous PowerVM driver supported by
+OpenStack.  This driver was removed from the tree as it did not have
+consumers.  It was not complete and did not support the direction of OpenStack
+to run directly on the compute node.
+
+Given the importance of doing it correctly, the PowerVM team has done
+significant work to rectify the issues of the past.  This includes reworking
+the hypervisor itself to be tuned for OpenStack.  This is done via the
+NovaLink feature, which enables management of a PowerVM system directly on the
+hypervisor.  This allows the nova-compute (as well as networking-powervm and
+ceilometer-powervm) agent to run directly on the system to match the OpenStack
+design.
+
+Additionally, IBM has built products directly on top of the StackForge drivers
+(such as PowerVC).  IBM is committed to this architecture and has publicly
+announced the new direction (https://ibm.biz/BdHsWS).  We have shifted
+development to the open-source OpenStack development model.  The activity of
+the nova-powervm project alone is currently over `400`_ commits.
+
+.. _400: https://github.com/openstack/nova-powervm
+
+
+Use Cases
+----------
+
+This driver makes the following use cases available for PowerVM:
+
+* As a deployer, all of the standard lifecycle operations (start, stop,
+  reboot, migrate, destroy, etc.) are supported on a PowerVM-based
+  instance.
+
+* VM Capture to Glance Image.
+
+* VM Deploy from Glance Image.
+
+* VNC console to instances deployed.
+
+* Migration of virtual machines that are attached to a common storage
+  backend.
+
+* Fibre Channel attached storage through standard Cinder operations.
+
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+Promote the PowerVM open source driver that is currently in
+openstack/nova-powervm into the Nova project. The driver code contributions
+will be decomposed into logical sections such that they are reasonably
+consumable for review.
+
+While the integration is continuing, the driver will continue to be worked and
+supported in the openstack/nova-powervm tree.
+
+It is requested that the core Nova team provide reviews for the change sets
+and the IBM POWER driver team will provide the associated code updates.
+
+The IBM POWER Systems team has made a firm commitment to long term
+development, maintenance, and support for this driver. Furthermore, this
+driver has been integrated into existing IBM products and will continue to be
+enhanced and supported.
+
+It should be noted that there are existing supported `networking-powervm`_ (a
+neutron ML2 compliant agent) and `ceilometer-powervm`_ (a telemetry component)
+agents that operators can make use of.
+
+The driver team is also working with the Chef deployment team to ensure that
+there is an open deployment model for the PowerVM drivers.
+
+.. _networking-powervm: https://launchpad.net/neutron-powervm/
+.. _ceilometer-powervm: https://launchpad.net/ceilometer-powervm/
+
+We also met with the Nova core team at previous summits and the Liberty
+mid-cycle meetup.  The approach proposed here was the recommendation from the
+Nova team at that time.  We believe that this solution meets the maturity
+requirements set forth by the Nova team:
+
+* Meets a minimum set of driver functions.
+
+* Provides a third party CI system with a non-gating vote
+
+* Has active consumers of the driver
+
+* Understanding and agreement from the PowerVM drivers team to provide ongoing
+  development and support
+
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+Alternatives were discussed with the Nova core team at previous summits and
+at the Liberty mid-cycle meeting. None were deemed appropriate.
+
+Alternatives to the proposal here are:
+
+* Leave the driver as a unofficial, third party driver in StackForge
+
+* Have the Nova project support an official, third-party driver model similar
+  to the "Big Tent" model in Neutron today.
+
+* Force an existing driver (e.g. Libvirt) to work against the NovaLink API
+
+* Use KVM on POWER via the libvirt driver.
+
+The first alternative is an unacceptable model for both operators and for
+OpenStack, as it creates a situation where the PowerVM driver is not held
+to the same standards as the other Group B drivers. The second option is
+something the Nova team does not support today. The third model is technically
+feasible, but greatly reduces the flexibility and function support for PowerVM
+and adds another layer of complexity to the PowerVM management stack that
+would fall on the operator.
+
+Running KVM on POWER is a viable alternative for certain workloads.  However,
+as noted in the problem description, PowerVM as a hypervisor may offer
+different benefits for operators to take advantage of within their cloud
+infrastructure.
+
+Nothing about the PowerVM driver will restrict the operator from having a
+heterogenous cloud.  As per the OpenStack Nova design, the PowerVM driver
+comfortably co-exists with other compute nodes of any hypervisor type.
+
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+No new data model fields.
+
+One of the deploy options does make use of an instance's system_metadata.
+This is due to how Cinder volumes are attached to the VM.
+
+There are two ways to connect a Cinder volume.  The first is Virtual SCSI,
+which takes a hard disk presented to the system and virtually connects it to
+the VM.  The second is N-Port ID Virtualization (NPIV), which connects a Fibre
+Channel disk directly to the VM.  The NPIV volume connector does make use of
+instance system metadata, to keep track of its Fibre Channel Fabric
+Connections (as the I/O is directly connected).  This is not a new field
+however, and seemed appropriate to use given that it is metadata directly
+about virtual adapters on the VM.
+
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+None.
+
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+
+None.
+
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+
+None.
+
+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+
+None.
+
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+It is a goal of the driver to deploy systems with similar speed and agility
+as other compute drivers within the OpenStack ecosystem.
+
+The driver is written and tested to support concurrent operations.  It has
+been validated while performing 10 concurrent deploys to given compute nodes.
+
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+The cloud administrator will need to refer to documentation on how to
+configure OpenStack for use with a PowerVM hypervisor.
+
+A 'powervm' configuration group is used to contain all the PowerVM specific
+configuration settings. Existing configuration file attributes are
+reused as much as possible (e.g. ``vif_plugging_timeout``). This reduces the
+number of PowerVM-specific items that will be needed.
+
+It is the goal of the project to only require minimal additional attributes.
+The deployer may specify additional attributes to fit their configuration.
+
+There is no impact to customers upgrading their cloud stack as this is a
+genesis driver and does not have database impacts.
+
+The PowerVM driver team will provide updates to the dev-ref and other
+documentation to assist the operator in configuration.  These can be evaluated
+in the nova-powervm `dev-ref`_.
+
+.. _dev-ref: https://github.com/openstack/nova-powervm/blob/master/doc/source
+
+
+Developer impact
+----------------
+
+The code will be proposed to the ``/nova/virt/powervm/ package``.  The PowerVM
+driver team will propose all of the changes there.  Other sections of Nova
+should not be impacted.

+
+The team will have members in the Nova IRC.  A new #openstack-powervm channel
+will also be available that the team members will sit in for driver development
+discussion, so as not to add unnecessary noise to the overall Nova IRC.  The
+team will reach out to the core Nova team in the standard Nova IRC however for
+integration questions.
+
+
+Work Items
+----------
+
+* Define the new folder and incorporate pypowervm dependency (see below).
+
+* Break the existing driver into logical components (e.g. code to create a VM,
+  destroy a VM, connect a volume, migrate a VM, etc.)
+
+* Propose logical components as independent changes.  Incorporate review
+  comments from team back into current nova-powervm project while merge is
+  ongoing.
+
+* Enable CI system to provide non-gating vote on proposed Nova changes.
+
+
+
+Dependencies
+============
+
+* Utilizes the PowerVM REST API specification for management.  Will
+  utilize future versions of this specification as it becomes available:
+  http://ibm.co/1lThV9R
+
+* Builds on top of the `pypowervm library`_.  This is a prerequisite to
+  utilizing the driver.
+
+.. _pypowervm library: https://github.com/pypowervm
+
+
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+A 3rd party CI system is in development.  Along with this, the PowerVM Drivers
+team will provide a set of maintainers for the CI.  This will provide a
+non-gating vote for all proposed changes to nova master.  The CI has been in
+development over the past several months, and plan to have it online soon.
+
+The tempest tests are generally implementation-agnostic; the existing
+tempest tests will be able to run against the PowerVM driver without issue.
+Certain tests may not run against the implementation, if the platform does
+not support the function.  E.g. iSCSI attached Cinder volumes (Fibre Channel
+is supported).
+
+Thorough unit tests exist within the project to validate specific functions
+within this implementation.
+
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+The existing `dev-ref`_ provides information on how to configure PowerVM
+driver.  This information will be refactored and merged in with the standard
+Nova documentation.
+
+The PowerVM Drivers team has also reached out to the OpenStack docs PTL.  The
+PowerVM Drivers team is proposing a blueprint for the PowerVM docs.  The
+intent is that the PowerVM team will update the documentation for operators,
+add to the hypervisor matrix, and appropritate surrounding documentation.
+These will be reviewed via the standard doc update process.  The doc blueprint
+will not be approved until the Nova blueprint is approved.
