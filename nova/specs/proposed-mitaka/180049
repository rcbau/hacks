+========================================================================
+Adding API to list the metrics names reported by compute monitor plugins
+========================================================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/compute-node-metrics-api
+
+We need to add an API to list the available metric names stored in the DB
+which is reported by the compute monitor plugins, so the administrator
+can easily configure the scheduler's MetricWeigher settings.
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+With the Icehouse blueprint implementation
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/utilization-aware-scheduling,
+now various monitor plug-ins can be configured to report hypervisor
+metrics periodically. These metrics could be used in scheduling process
+through the MetricsWeigher configured by the administrator.
+
+When the administrator wants to configure the settings for MetricsWeigher,
+he/she need to know the exact metric names to make the settings working
+properly. Currently, we don't have a way to let the administrator know what
+metrics are available unless asking the administrator to look at the monitor
+plug-ins code or looking in certain DB tables.
+
+We need to add an API to list the available metric names currently reported
+by the nova compute monitors and stored in the DB, so the administrator
+can configure the MetricWeigher much more easily.
+
+Use Cases
+----------
+
+The Administrator will use this API to list all the available metric names,
+in order to configure the MetricsWeigher to work as expected.
+
+Project Priority
+-----------------
+
+None
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+A new method will be added in nova.compute.monitors.ResourceMonitorBase class
+that would return a list of the metric names that each plugin supports.
+
+A new top-level REST API resource will be added, it simply lists the metric
+names which is returned by the new method mentioned above:
+
+    GET /v2.1/metrics
+
+This new API by default is admin only.
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+The current os-hypervisors API extension can list all the information about
+the compute node hypervisor. It pulls the information from the DB, but it
+ignores the metrics related information.
+
+We need to modified the os-hypervisors API extension to list the metrics
+of each compute node hypervisor through the following restful API call:
+
+    GET /v2.1/os-hypervisors/{hypervisor_id}/metrics
+
+The above API would query the DB and return the metrics stored in the DB
+for the specified compute node hypervisor.
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+None
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+A new API is added:
+
+GET /v2.1/metrics
+
+A array 'metrics' will be returned in the response of this API, listing
+all the metrics names. The response will looks like::
+
+    200 OK
+    {
+        "metrics": [
+            'cpu.kernel.time',
+            'cpu.user.time',
+            ......
+        ]
+    }
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+
+Relevant policy will only allow this API be accessed by administrator.
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+
+None
