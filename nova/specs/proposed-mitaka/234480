+VMware: Storage of vCenter passwords in Keystone credential store
+=================================================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/vmware-encrypt-vcenter-passwords
+
+This blueprint is proposal for how vCenter passwords can be securely stored
+in the keystone credential store rather than as plain text in the nova.conf
+file.
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+Today there are two config options representing the credentials necessary for
+the VMware driver to properly communicate with the vCenter Server. They are:
+host_username and host_password. The primary concern of some deployers is that
+the vCenter usernames and passwords are stored in plain text inside the
+nova.conf file.
+
+This problem statement only applies to the VMware credenitals stored in
+nova.conf. It does not attempt to address the more general issue of plain text
+passwords being stored in \*.conf files.
+
+Use Cases
+----------
+
+As a deployer, I wish to configure Nova for the VMware driver using my
+user/password stored in a secure manner.
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+The proposed solution is to utilize the leverage the existing keystone
+credential store a repository for the vCenter user/password.
+
+The flow would be as follows:
+- The openstack command line is used to create a new credential for the nova
+user in keystone's credential store (openstack credential create).
+- The values in nova.conf for host_username and host_password are left empty.
+- When the VMware Nova driver starts it will fetch the user and password from
+Keystone if they are undefined in nova.conf.
+
+The Keystone credential store is a v3 API, so there is a dependency on Nova
+using this version.
+
+Also, note that is it not required that the username and password to be stored
+in this credential store.  A deployer may still put these values in the
+nova.conf.
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+Some suggestions have been to use Barbican for storing credentials. But not all
+deployments have Barbican.  Unlike Barbican, Keystone is always required in
+order to deploy OpenStack.

+
+Work Items
+----------
+
+Should be a single work item (patch) to update the VMware driver to fetch the
+vCenter user/password from the Keystone credential store when undefined in
+nova.conf.
+
+Dependencies
+============
+
+Nova must be using the keystone middleware which supports the Keystone v3 API.
+This dependency should already be satisfied.
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+The testing should be rather straightforward. A deployment should be tested
+with and without the user/password of vCenter in the Keystone credential store
+and verify communication of the driver to vCenter still works properly.
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+The deployment flow described above should be documented as an alternative way
+of deploying the VMware compute driver in a more secure manner.
