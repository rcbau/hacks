Subject: [PATCH] Remove shared storage flag in evacuate API

Today evacuate API expects a onSharedStorage flag to be provided by the admin
however this information can be detected by the virt driver as well. To ease
the work of the admin and to allow easier automation of the evacuation tasks
this spec proposes to remove the onSharedStorage flag from the API.

+Remove shared storage flag in evacuate API
+==========================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/remove-shared-storage-flag-in-evacuate-api
+
+Today evacuate API expects an onSharedStorage flag to be provided by the admin
+however this information can be detected by the virt driver as well. To ease
+the work of the admin and to allow easier automation of the evacuation tasks
+this spec propose to remove the onSharedStorage flag from the API in a new
+microversion.
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+Use Cases
+---------
+When an instance needs to be evacuated from a failed host the admin has to
+check if the instance was stored on shared storage or not to issue the evacuate
+command properly. The admin wants to rely on the virt driver to detect if
+the instance data is available on the target host and use it if possible for
+the evacuation.
+An external automatic evacuation engine also wants to let nova to decide
+if the instance can be evacuated without rebuilding it on the target host.
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+In compute manager in the rebuild_instance function the on_shared_storage
+flag is made optional with a previous spec so that the onSharedStorage
+parameter now can be removed from the evacuate API.
+
+The evacuate API supports providing a new admin password optionally. This
+makes the solution a bit more complicated.
+Nova can only decide if the instance is on shared storage if the target host
+of the evacuation is already known which means only after the scheduler
+selected the new host because nova needs to check if the disk of the instance
+is visible from the target host. However the evacuation API call returns the
+new admin password in the response. This logic cannot be fully kept if the
+onSharedStorage flag is removed.
+
+There are two cases to consider if the onSharedStorage flag is removed:
+
+* Client doesn't provide admin password. Nova will generate a new password.
+  If nova finds that the instance is on shared storage then
+  the instance will be rebooted and will use the same admin password as before.
+  If nova finds that the instance is not on shared storage then the instance
+  will be recreated and the newly generated admin password will be used.
+* Client provides admin password.
+  If nova finds that the instance is on shared storage then
+  the password the client provided will be silently ignored. If nova finds
+  that the instance is not on shared storage then the provided password will
+  be injected to the recreated instance.
+
+This spec propose to
+
+* Remove the onSharedStorage parameter of the
+  /v2.1/{tenant_id}/servers/{server_id}/action API
+* Remove adminPass from the response body of the API call. Admin user can still
+  access the generated password via
+  /v2.1/{tenant_id}/servers/{server_id}/os-server-password API
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+For the automation use case the alternative would be to reimplement the
+checking of the instance availability on the disk in the theoretical external
+evacuation engine. However this would be a clear code duplication as nova
+already contains this check in the virt driver.
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+None
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+The onSharedStorage parameter of the
+/v2.1/{tenant_id}/servers/{server_id}/action API will be removed.
+So the relate JSON schema would be change to the following::
+
+    {
+    'type': 'object',
+    'properties': {
+        'evacuate': {
+            'type': 'object',
+            'properties': {
+                'host': parameter_types.hostname,
+                'adminPass': parameter_types.admin_password,
+            },
+            'required': [],
+            'additionalProperties': False,
+        },
+    },
+    'required': ['evacuate'],
+    'additionalProperties': False,
+    }
+
+Also the adminPass will be removed from the response body.
+This would make the response body empty therefore the API response
+will not return a response body instead.
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+None
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+None
+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+None

+Performance Impact
+------------------
+None
+
+Other deployer impact

+None
+
+Developer impact

+None

+
+Work Items
+----------
+
+* Remove onSharedStorage from the evacuate REST API
+* Remove adminPass and therefore the whole response body of the evacuate API
+* Remove on_shared_storage from the rebuild_instance in the compute manager

+
+Dependencies
+============
+This spec depends on the bp
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/optional-on-shared-storage-flag-in-rebuild-instance
+
+Testing
+=======
+Unit and functional test coverage will be provided.
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+Admin guide needs to be updated with the new behavior of the evacuate
+function.
