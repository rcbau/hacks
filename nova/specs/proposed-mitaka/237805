Subject: [PATCH] VMware: placement policies within cluster

This will provide a mechanism to do instance placement with vcenter
cluster by ensuring the affinity and anti-affintity policies
at ESX host level. In addition, provide ability to do placement
on a group of hosts.

+VMware: placement policies within cluster
+==========================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/vmware-placement-policy
+
+This will provide a mechanism to do instance placement with vcenter
+cluster by ensuring the affinity and anti-affintity policies
+at ESX host level. In addition, provide ability to do placement
+on a group of hosts.
+
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+Currently, nova scheduler sees a vcenter cluster as a compute node.
+Because of this abstraction, affinity placement policy is not
+guaranteed at ESX host level and anti-affinity policy could place maximum
+of only one instance per group on a cluster. This violates the user
+defined policies (in case of affinity rules) and impacts resource utilization
+within cluster.
+The proposal is to inspect the policies from server group object
+and automatically create rules on vcenter cluster to satisfy the
+placement policy at ESX host level.
+
+In addition, the notion of host aggregates is also not available at ESX host
+level because of using clusters.
+To support placement policies on a group/aggregate of ESX hosts,
+add a new image property "vmware_vm_group" which could be used do the
+placement based on the group policy defined on cluster."
+
+Use Cases
+----------
+
+Tenants want to place instances based on affinity (example: database and
+application servers) and anti-affinity (say, for fault tolerance)
+policy using nova VMware driver. This is a requirement for multi-tier
+Telco setups.
+
+Admins/tenants would want certain VNF workloads to run only on specific
+set of hosts within a cluster to meet SLA guarantees.
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+The proposal is to leverage the server groups API for vm-vm affinity and
+anti-affinity policies within vcenter cluster. And add a new image metadata
+'vmware_vm_group' that corresponds to vcenter vm group for vm-host
+placement policies.
+
+Currently, nova scheduler has the following filters to expresses affinity and
+anti-affinity rules between instances.
+1. ServerGroupAffinityFilter
+2. ServerGroupAntiAffinityFilter
+
+These filters work in combination with server group API.
+Through server group API, tenants can specify the policies as 'affinity' or
+'anti-affinity'. In VMware driver, the policy information will be retrieved and
+affinity/anti-affinity rules will be created automatically on the vc cluster.
+
+This would make the behavior of ServerGroupAffinityFilter and
+ServerGroupAntiAffinityFilter similar to other reference drivers.
+
+For vm-host placement policy, VMware driver will read the image metadata
+'vmware_vm_group' and associate the instance to the corresponding vm
+group folder on vcenter cluster. The vm-host policy defined within cluster
+can then take care of placement on specific host(s).
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+Given the abstraction of cluster as a compute node in VMware VC driver, there
+are no other alternatives.

+Performance Impact

+None
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+For vm-vm affinity/anti-affinity policy, there is no change in deployment.
+
+The following examples demonstrates how existing commands can be used.
+
+Users would create server group with a policy as:
+nova server-group-create --policy <affinity|anti-affinity> <group name>
+
+Now, an instance can be deployed by passing scheduler hint
+group=<uuid of server instance group>
+
+nova boot --image <image id> --flavor <flavor id>
+--hint group=<uuid of server instance group> <instance name>
+
+For vm-host placement policy, admins have to update image metadata
+'vmware_vm_group'. Here is a sample format:
+glance image-update <image id> --property vmware_vm_group=<vm group name>
+
+Then booting an instance with this image would automatically place it on
+corresponding vm group within vcenter.

+
+Work Items
+----------
+
+* Define new image metadata 'vmware_vm_group'
+* Modify VMware driver to parse the 'vmware_vm_group' image property and
+  place the vm on corresponding vm group
+* Modify VMware driver to get server group object, read the policy and
+  automatically create rules on vcenter cluster
+
+Dependencies
+============
+
+None
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+Functional tests are better for this feature because it requires
+querying configuring vcenter directly.
+Currently, there are no functional tests for VMware driver.
+Defining functional tests for VMware driver may be outside the scope
+of this spec.
+
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+The user documentation for VMware driver should be updated about
+the new image metadata 'vmware_vm-group'.
