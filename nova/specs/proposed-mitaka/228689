Subject: [PATCH] Host maintenance mode

Provide a default host maintenance mode handling to enable compute node
machines to upgrade OS or hardware without pausing running instances in
Nova compute, independant to drivers.

Implements: blueprint host-maintenance-mode

+==========================================
+Host maintenance mode
+==========================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/host-maintenance-mode
+
+Implement "nova host-update XXX --maintenance enable/disable" command, which
+is used to do OS and hardware upgrade without pausing running instances.
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+When executing the following command on a KVM box:
+    nova host-update XXX --maintenance enable
+
+it returns the following error:
+    ERROR (HTTPNotImplemented): Virt driver does not implement host
+    maintenance mode.
+
+Since Nova compute does not provide a default host maintenance handling
+process, it passes the request to driver. But libvirt driver has not
+implemented host maintenance mode either. So on a KVM box, it returns
+HTTPNotImplemented. As a result, we cannot run host maintenance command
+on a KVM box.
+
+Use Cases
+----------
+
+In a workload cloud, nova compute nodes need to be maintained (such as system
+or hardware upgrade) from time to time. But the service or VMs running on the
+nodes cannot be paused to minimize the effect to users. So we need this
+functionality to put a compute node to maintenance mode so that no VM will be
+scheduled to run on this node and no new instance will be create on this node.

+Project Priority

+None
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+When "nova host-update XXX --maintenance enable" is executed, host maintenance
+mode process should work as below:
+1. Disable the compute service on the compute node.
+2. Migrate all instances on the compute node.
+It is more like two novaclient commands: "nova service-disable" and
+"nova host-evacuate-live".
+
+So this functionality should be implement like this:
+1. On Nova side, host_maintenance_mode() API in Nova is not implemented. It
+pass the request to driver directly. In order to keep Nova as a low level
+infrastructure API, implement a default host_maintenance_mode() API to simply
+enable/disable compute service, so that drivers who have not implemented one
+could fall back to it.
+Refer to: http://docs.openstack.org/developer/nova/project_scope.html#no-more-orchestration
+
+2. On Nova client side, improve "host-update" command as below:
+a) Disable compute service.
+b) Call evacuation or migration process to migrate all instances.

+Work Items
+----------
+
+* On Nova side, implement a default host_maintenance_mode() API to enable
+  and disable compute service.
+* On Nova client side, improve "nova host-update" so that it can disable
+  compute service and migrate all instances.
