to support booting from Cinder volume (in tandem with
other changes proposed in Ironic).

+================================
+Ironic - Boot from Cinder volume
+================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/ironic-boot-from-volume
+
+This spec captures the changes required in Nova Ironic virt driver
+to enable Ironic to boot bare metal machines from Cinder volume, when
+requested from Nova.
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+Currently, there is no way to request a bare metal compute resource from Nova
+that boots from a Cinder volume.  Ironic also doesn't support it.  But with
+some changes proposed in Ironic ([1] and [2]), it will enable Ironic to boot
+bare metal servers from a remote volume.  Ironic virt driver needs to pass the
+remote volume connection information down to Ironic when spawning a new
+bare metal instance requesting it to boot from a Cinder volume.
+
+A bare metal hardware using a Cinder volume is more secure in a multi-tenant
+environment, as tenants don't get to see other's data by doing something
+malicious on the system's or disk's firmware. Booting from SAN also provides
+better data protection at lower cost including support for snapshots and
+replication.
+
+Use Cases
+----------
+
+A tenant can request a bare metal server that boots from a Cinder volume.
+
+Project Priority
+-----------------
+
+None.
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+* Whenever an instance that boots from a Cinder volume is requested in Nova, it
+  queries the virt driver to provide the volume connectors for the hypervisor.
+  Virt drivers should implement the method ``get_volume_connector`` in the Nova
+  driver API.  Ironic virt driver should implement this method which hits the
+  Ironic endpoint ``GET /v1/volume_connectors?node=<node_uuid>`` in the Ironic
+  API. The Ironic API will provide the volume connectors for the bare metal.
+
+  If ``ip`` doesn't exist in the volume connectors returned from the API,
+  Ironic virt driver should query Neutron to get the private IP assigned to the
+  MAC address ``mac`` (which is the MAC address of the iSCSI initiator). If
+  ``ip`` is not returned, then it means that storage network is managed by
+  Neutron.
+
+* Nova Ironic virt driver should pass the ``connection_info`` of the block
+  device passed to the ``spawn()`` method to Ironic.  The Nova Ironic virt
+  driver should add an attribute in Ironic node's instance_info for each
+  attribute in ``connection_info``.  For example, for an iSCSI Cinder volume,
+  the Nova Ironic virt driver should write the ``target_iqn``, ``target_lun``,
+  ``target_portal``, ``auth_method``, ``auth_username`` and ``auth_password``
+  to the Ironic node's instance_info.
+
+.. note::
+
+  The scheduler changes to pick up a suitable bare metal node which can support
+  booting from a particular volume should be taken care of in the spec which
+  covers the changes in scheduling mechanism for the Ironic virt driver ([3]
+  and [4]).
