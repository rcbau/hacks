+Hyper-V vTPM Devices
+====================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/hyper-v-vtpm-devices
+
+Windows / Hyper-V Server Technical Preview introduced the ability to attach
+vTPM devices to the Hyper-V VMs, offering the users the posibility to use it
+to enhance their security and system integrity.
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+Currently, there Hyper-V Driver doesn't support adding vTPM devices to
+instances. This blueprint is addresing this issue.
+
+Use Cases
+----------
+
+Trusted Platform Module (TPM) technology is designed to provide hardware-based,
+security-related functions and it includes multiple security mechanisms to make
+it tamper resistant. Some of the key advantages of using TPM technology are:
+
+* Generate, store, and limit the use of cryptographic keys.
+* Use TPM technology for platform device authentication by using the TPMâ€™s
+  unique RSA key, which is burned into itself.
+* Help ensure platform integrity by taking and storing security measurements.
+* TPM-based Virtual Smart Card.
+
+The shielded VMs make use of the vTPM devices. Shielded VMs should be used in
+cases where the security of the spawned instance is essential. They are
+encrypted (BitLocker or other means), ensuring that the only the designated
+owners can access the virtual machine. [2]
+
+A few features of the Shielded VMs are:
+
+* Cannot inspect the disks.
+* Cannot inspect the memory.
+* Canoot inspect the processes.
+* Cannot attach debuggers to the system.
+* Cannot change the configuration.
+
+In short, even if the administrator of the hypervisor host is compromised, all
+the existent virtual machine data is safe.
+
+For more information and use cases for vTPM, check the References section [1].
+
+Project Priority
+-----------------
+
+None
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+This feature is not available in earlier versions than Windows / Hyper-V Server
+Technical Preview. vTPM devices cannot be created on an earlier version.
+
+If the given instance requires a vTPM device but it does not contain the
+``hw_machine_type=hyperv-gen2`` image property, the instance creation will
+fail, as vTPM can be only added for Generation 2 VMs. Generation 2 VMs were
+introduced in Windows / Hyper-V Server 2012 R2 and support for them was
+introduced in the Kilo release (see Dependencies section).
+
+As vTPM is not supported by all guests, enabling it for instances that do not
+support it is pointless. Thus, creating instances with vTPM devices is done by
+setting the ``os_vtpm`` image property or the ``os:vtpm`` flavor extra spec to
+``required``. Other possible values are: ``disabled`` and ``optional``. The
+flavor extra spec value overrides the image property value.
+
+The image property ``os_vtpm_keys`` contains a comma separated UUID list,
+which are references to the Barbican stored secrets. Maximum 6 references can
+be added, due to nova InstanceSystemMetadata model's limitation to 255 bytes.
+Those secrets contains data that must be set into the vTPM. This is mandatory
+for Shielded VMs. Providing this image property without requesting a vTPM
+device will result in an exception. If one of the Barbican secrets cannot be
+fetched, an exception will be raised.
+
+Scheduling is assured by the ImagePropertiesFilter [5], which checks if the
+image property ``hypervisor_version_requires`` is satisfied by the given
+hosts. This is the initial approach to solving the scheduling problem. Ideally,
+this problem will be solved by exposing this feature as a host capability and
+having the ``os_vtpm_device`` image property or ``os:vtpm_device`` flavor extra
+spec match the host capability.
+
+The following operations are to be implemented:
+
+* Add Barbican authentication config options.
+* Fetch the vTPM keys from Barbican using python-barbicanclient and the image
+  property ``os_vtpm_keys``, which is a comma separated UUID list, which are
+  references to Barbican secrets.
+* Create Host Guardian Service KeyProtector with the previously fetched
+  encyption key and register it in the Host Guardian, if the image property
+  ``os_vtpm_keys`` is provided.
+* Add vTMP device to the Generation 2 VM, enable it and add the previously
+  created KeyProtector to it.

+Data model impact

+None
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+None
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+
+Users will be able to use vTPM, which is useful to control access control and
+authentication. This can lead to enhanced VM security.
+
+The VM encryption keys must be protected. They will have to be stored in
+Barbican as secrets, and make sure that the service is properly set up. For
+more information, see the References section [4].
+
+Notifications impact

+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+None
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+In order for this feature to be usable, the Host Guardian Service will have
+to be enabled and the hosts must be Guarded (the Guardian Service key must be
+imported in the local host). [2]
+
+Barbican is needed, in order to properly use this feature [4]. It will be used
+to store the VM encryption keys as secrets. In order to be able to use it,
+config options regarding Barbican authentication will have to be set in the
+compute node's nova.conf file, under the [barbican] section. A sample will be
+provided. (WIP)
+
+VMs with vTPMs cannot be migrated from an Active Directory to another or to
+an Unguarded Host. In order to ensure that the scheduler will not pick a host
+outside the current Active Directory, all the Guarded Hosts in the Active
+Directory should be added to the same aggregate.
+
+This feature is only available in Windows / Hyper-V Server Technical Preview
+and in order to ensure proper scheduling, the ``hypervisor_version_requires``
+image property should be set to ``>=10.0``.
+
+The images must be prepared for Shielded VMs. For example, the VM on which the
+image is prepared, it must be Generation 2 VM, have a vTPM device with a
+Host Guardian Service KeyProtector set. The attached drives must be encrypted
+using BitLocker or any encryption program [2]. Then, the key data must be
+stored into Barbican as a secret. [4]
+
+In order to create instances with vTPM device attached, the user will have to
+request it in the following ways:
+
+* Image property ``os_vtpm`` set to ``required``.
+* Image property ``os_vtpm`` set to ``optional`` and flavor extra spec
+  ``os:vtpm`` set to ``required``.
+
+Contradicting image property and flavor extra spec will result in failing to
+create instance.
+
+Any key data should be stored into Barbican as secrets and create the image
+property ``os_vtpm_keys`` containing the the comma separated references to the
+secrets (maximum 6 references, due to a length limitation - maximum 255
+characters), otherwise the instances will be spawned with no data stored in the
+vTPMs. Example value: UUID1,UUID2,UUID3
+
+If the ``os_vtpm_keys`` image property is set, the image property
+``os_vtpm`` or the flavor extra spec ``os:vtpm`` must be set to ``required``,
+otherwise the instance will not spawn.
+
+Image creation example:
+
+  glance image-create --property hypervisor_type=hyperv \
+        --property hw_machine_type=hyperv-gen2 \
+        --property hypervisor_version_requires='>=10.0' \
+        --property os_vtpm=required \
+        --property os_vtpm_keys=$key_refs --name im-secure \
+        --disk-format vhd --container-format bare --file path/to/image.vhdx
+
+or
+
+  glance image-update --property hw_machine_type=hyperv-gen2 win-secure
+
+  glance image-update --property hypervisor_version_requires='>=10.0' im-secure
+
+  glance image-update --property os_vtpm=required im-secure
+
+  glance image-update --property os_vtpm_keys=$key_refs im-secure
+
+The ``os_vtpm`` image property acceptable values are:
+``disabled, optional, required``. If the property is not defined, ``disabled``
+will be used as default value. The ``optional`` value means that the image
+guest OS can use the vTPM, but it will require the flavor extra spec in order
+for the instance to be created with a vTPM device.
+
+Flavor extra spec example:
+
+  nova flavor-key m1.your.flavor set "os:vtpm=required"
