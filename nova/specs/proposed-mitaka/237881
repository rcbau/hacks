Subject: [PATCH] Expose quiece unquiece API

Provide atomic quiesce / unquiesce API from Nova, to make consistency
snapshot of a group of VMs in a transaction way is possible, for
example, quiesce VM1, quiesce VM2, quiesce VM3, snapshot VM1's volumes,
snapshot VM2's volumes, snapshot VM3's volumes, unquiesce VM3, unquiesce
VM2, unquiesce VM1. For some telecom application, the order is
important for a group of VMs with strong relationship.

+Expose Quiesce Unquiesce API
+=====================================================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/expose-quiesce-unquiesce-api
+
+Provide atomic quiesce unquiesce API from Nova, to make consistency snapshot
+of a group of VMs in a transaction way is possible
+
+Problem description
+===================
+Currently the Nova provides VM snapshot API, which will take a consistency
+snapshot of a VM and regarding volumes, and will quiesce/unquiesce VM
+automatily with guest agent support.This method is good for single VM
+consistency snapshot, but no way to make consistency snapshot of a group
+of VMs in a transaction way.
+
+Use Cases
+---------
+
+In NFV scenario, a VNF (telecom application) often is consisted of a group
+of VMs. To make it be able to restore in another site for catastrophic
+failures happened, this group of VMs snapshot/backup/restore should be done
+in a transaction way to guarantee the application level consistency but not
+only on single VM level : for example, quiesce VM1, quiesce VM2, quiesce VM3,
+snapshot VM1's volumes, snapshot VM2's volumes, snapshot VM3's volumes,
+unquiesce VM3, unquiesce VM2, unquiesce VM1. For some telecom application,
+the order is very important for a group of VMs with strong relationship.
+
+Therefore the OPNFV multsite project expects Nova to provide atomic quiesce
+unquiesce API, to make consistency snapshot of a group of VMs in a transaction
+way is possible (but not only one single VM instead).
+
+The disater recovery will work like this:
+
+1)GR(Geo site redundancy)software get the attached volumes for the VMs in a
+VNF from Nova
+2)GR software add these attached volumes to the  consistency group in Cinder
+3)GR software call Nova API Quiesce to freeze VMs and flush buffer in order
+4)GR software make cgsnapshots of these volumes in Cinder(NOTE: Because
+storage often provides fast snapshot, so the duration between quiece and
+unquiece is a short interval)
+5)GR software call Nova API unquiesce VMs in reverse order
+6)GR software create volumes from the cgsnapshots in Cinder
+7)GR software create backup (incremental) for these volumes to remote
+backup storage ( swift or ceph, or.. ) in Cinder
+8)if this site failed,
+8.1)GR software restore these backup volumes in remote Cinder in the backup
+site.
+8.2)GR software boot vm from bootable volume from the remote Cinder in the
+backup site and attach the regarding data volumes.
+
+Note: It's up to the GR policy and VNF character how to use the API. Some
+VNF may allow the standby of the VNF or member of the cluster to do
+quiece/unquiece to avoid interfering the service provided by the VNF.
+Some other VNF may afford short unavailable for GR purpose.
+
+The use case has been discussed and agreed in OPNFV multisite project:
+https://wiki.opnfv.org/multisite
+
+Agreed in the meeting of this project: http://ircbot.wl.linuxfoundation.org/meetings/opnfv-meeting/2015/opnfv-meeting.2015-09-03-08.02.html
+People who joined the meeting and from: Ericsson, Metaswitch, NTT Docomo,
+Nokia, Huawei.

+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+Expose 'quiesce' and 'unquiesce' admin actions for GR software.
+
+Add a 'quiesce' and 'unquiesce' method for each driver. In libvirt driver,
+if QEMU Guest Agent is enabled in an instance, the guest agent is called
+to freeze the filesystems (and applications if fsfreeze-hook is installed)
+by 'quiesce' method. The 'unquiesce' method will thaw them.
+
+The prerequisites of this feature are:
+
+1. the hypervisor is 'qemu' or 'kvm'
+
+2. libvirt >= 1.2.5 (which has fsFreeze/fsThaw API) is installed in the
+hypervisor
+
+3. 'hw_qemu_guest_agent=yes' properties are set on the image metadata,
+   and QEMU Guest Agent is installed and enabled in the instance
+
+When these conditions are not satisfied, the methods will fail by
+'QuiesceUnsupportedException'.
+When quiesce is failed even though these conditions are satisfied
+(e.g. the agent is not responding), the methods fail by the other
+exception, such as LibvirtException.

+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+None
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+* URL:
+    * /v2/{tenant_id}/servers/{server_id}/action:
+    * /v2.1/servers/{server_id}/action/{server_id}/action:
+
+* Request method:
+    * POST
+
+* JSON request body for 'quiesce'::
+
+        {
+            "quiesce": null
+        }
+
+* JSON request body for 'unquiesce'::
+
+        {
+            "unquiesce": null
+        }
+
+* This operation does not return a response body.
+
+* Normal response code:
+    * `200 OK`: Returned after the instances' filesystes are successfully
+      quiesced/unquiesced.
+
+* Error response codes:
+    * `500 Internal Server Error`: Returned if the driver fails to
+      quiesce/unquiesce
+    * For malformed requests, other error codes may be returned like the other
+      server admin actions.

+
+None
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+While taking quiece, disk writes from the instance are blocked.

+
+Work Items
+----------
+
+1. Add 'quiesce' and 'unquiesce' server admin actions APIs for Nova
+2. Enable the test to run in CI with libvirt >= 1.2.5
+
+Dependencies
+============
+
+None
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+Live quiece/unquice of VMs with a guest booted with qemu-guest-agent should
+be added to scenario tests.
+Note that it requires environment with libvirt >= 1.2.5.
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+New REST APIs (server admin actions) should be added to the API documentation.
+Also, need to document how to use this feature in the operation guide (which
+currently recommends you use the fsfreeze tool manually).
