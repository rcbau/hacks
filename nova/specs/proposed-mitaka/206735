+Get quota and usage from neutron for limit APIs
+===============================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/limits-quota-usage-from-neutron
+
+On a system configured to use Neutron, for the limits API, we should retrieve
+quota and usage for floating IPs and security groups from Neutron,
+rather than Nova DB.
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+If Neutron is configured in an Openstack installation and the Nova quota and
+usage APIs are called, incorrect data from the Nova database will be returned
+to the caller, since Nova is not currently proxying Neutron to get the correct
+information.
+
+Use Cases
+----------
+
+As a cloud administrator, I need accurate networking information returned
+from the Nova limits API, whether or not if Neutron is configured in my
+cloud.
+
+Project Priority
+-----------------
+
+None
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+This change will be made in the v3 limits and used_limits controllers.  The
+v2 API will not be changed and will operate the same as it always has
+operated.
+
+v2.1 will operate as it currently does also.  A new microversion, starting
+at version 2.2 will be used for the UsedLimitsController and LimitsController.
+In this microversion, a check will be made to determine if Neutron is configured.
+If it is configured, a proxy call will be made to the following Neutron APIs:
+* list_floatingips
+* list_security_groups
+* show_quota
+
+A previous patch implementation can be found here:
+https://review.openstack.org/#/c/43822/
+
+The plan is to update the above patch, so comment and change history is persisted.
+The following changes need to be made in the patch:
+* The above patch is coded using the v2 API.  This will be moved to v3 instead
+* v2 limits and used_limits controllers changes will be reverted
+* Tests will be updated to call the 2.2 microversion
+* All stale, unmerged method calls will be updated to use the latest APIs
+  
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+* 1. fail - Patch located here: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/199604/
+    - Since we already return data, which is incorrect, it is more consistent
+        to continue returning data, but the correct data
+* 2. return -1 or some other indicator for floating ips and security groups 
+        indicating that Nova doesn't know the information without going to
+        Neutron.
+    - Not a great solution since we don't give a reason why we aren't
+        returning the data
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+None
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+Addition of microversion 2.2 for UsedLimitsController and LimitsController
+controllers.
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+
+None
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+
+None
+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+
+None
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+There will be a small amount of overhead while calling the Neutron API, but
+the performance impact should be minimal.
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+None
+
+Developer impact
+----------------
+
+None

+None
+
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+* Test v2.2 with Neutron configured
+* Test v2.2 without Neutron configured
+* Test v2 and v2.1 to ensure Neutron data is not returned
+* Test passthru of errors from Neutron
+
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+API documentation for the Nova limits API should be updated
+to state the 2.2 microversion updates
