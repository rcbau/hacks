Subject: [PATCH] Add tooz service group driver

This specification proposes adding a new service group driver based that
makes use of tooz (a new oslo library).
It also talks about deprecating the existing Zookeeper and Memcache
service group drivers, and a migration strategy to the new tooz driver.

+=================================================================
+Replace Zookeeper, Memcache servicegroup driver with Tooz drivers
+=================================================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/tooz-for-service-groups
+
+Nova's zookeeper and memcache service group drivers have fallen into
+disrepair. `tooz`_ (a new oslo library that has been under development
+for around a year) is able to provide the grouping concepts in a way
+that means nova would no longer need to maintain the zookeeper and memcache
+service group drivers.
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+Nova currently has to maintain, test and support db, memcache, zookeeper
+drivers. The db driver is currently the only widely deployed driver.
+
+The memcache and zookeepr drivers have since fallen into disrepair.
+For example, the Zookeeper driver uses evzookeeper which is no longer actively
+maintained and doesn't work with eventlet >= 0.17.1.
+
+If Nova adds a `tooz`_ service group driver, it means Nova can deprecate the
+existing zookeeper and memcache drivers, and eventually no longer have to
+maintain that code.
+
+Longer term, its hoped users will be able to migrate away from the db driver
+to the more promising systems supported by `tooz`_, but this effort it outside
+the scope of this specification.
+
+Use Cases
+----------
+
+* In scope: Migrate existing memcache and zookeeper driver users to the
+  new tooz service group driver
+
+* Out of scope: Existing db driver users migrate to the tooz driver
+
+Project Priority
+-----------------
+
+None
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+Before this effort can start, we need to fix the service group API
+abstraction:
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/servicegroup-api-control-plane
+
+The above effort is likely to extend the amount of the data that needs
+to be stored by tooz, such as if the node is enabled or disabled.
+At the same time, this will make clear many of the current limitations of the
+existing non-DB service group drivers that need to be avoided in the
+tooz driver.
+
+A ToozServiceGroupDriver will be added that implements the existing
+ServiceGroupDriver interface. Although the above work may adjust the
+interface slightly.
+
+It will simply wrap calls into the `tooz`_ library, and raise Nova
+specific exceptions for errors that are hit.
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+We could do nothing, but that is unlikely to get the broken drivers fixed,
+leading to lots of confusion for users, and painful upgrades.
+
+We could just drop support for memcache and zookeeper service group drivers
+all together, but there appears to be a community that wants to support them
+via `tooz`_ and it would be good to support that community.
+
+We could attempt a live-upgrade from Nova's memcache and zookeeper drivers
+to the new `tooz`_ driver, but given those drivers appear to be currently
+broken, that seems like wasted effort. User feedback during the deprecation
+cycle can be used to decide if this is needed before we remove the drivers
+from the Nova code base.
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+The DB service group driver will be unaffected by this change.
+
+The memcache and zookeeper drivers do not store information in those system in
+the same way that `tooz`_ stores information. But Nova is just a user of the
+`tooz`_ library, so we can skip over the details of that change here.
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+None
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+
+None
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+
+None
+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+
+None
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+None expected, there will still need to be periodic heartbeats into memcache
+to ensure the memcache key is not expired, zookeeper clients (even using
+`kazoo`_ also need to periodically check-in with zookeeper) so nothing should
+be drastically different in this arena.
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+There will be a new configuration value for the `tooz` driver, using a URL.
+A few examples of this URL format::
+
+    servicegroup_tooz_url = "kazoo://127.0.0.1:2181?timeout=5"
+    servicegroup_tooz_url = "memcached://localhost:11211?timeout=5"
+    servicegroup_tooz_url = "redis://localhost:6379?timeout=5"
+
+Given the current state of Nova's memcache and zookeeper drivers,
+we are adopting a very simple transition approach.
+It will be something like:
+
+* Upgrade to liberty, using existing service group driver
+
+* Restart nova-compute first.
+
+* Update configuration to point at new service group driver
+
+* Restart nova-api after updating configuration.
+
+We will look for feedback from users on this approach during the deprecation
+window for the memcache and zookeeper drivers, to assess if the simpler
+approach will be sufficient.
+
+
+Developer impact
+----------------
+
+Nova developers may have to interact more with the oslo community (and
+the tooz subcommunity) when learning, understanding, and integrating with
+tooz.
+
+Implementation
+==============
+
+Assignee(s)
+-----------
+
+Primary assignee:
+vilobhmm
+
+Work Items
+----------
+
+* Implement the new tooz servicegroup driver.
+
+* Document the migration from existing drivers to the tooz driver,
+  including the implementation of any required data migration.
+
+* Add deprecation warnings for memcache and zookeeper drivers.
+
+* Complete testing work detailed below.
+
+Dependencies
+============
+
+This spec adds a dependency on tooz
+
+This work also depends on the work to tidy up the service group API:
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/servicegroup-api-control-plane
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+* Work with infra to ensure one of the gate jobs starts using the tooz driver
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+* Describe the new tooz driver and its configuration options
+
+* Describe how to migrate from memcacahe or zookeeper to `tooz`
+
+* Communicate the deprecation of the memcache and zookeeper drivers
