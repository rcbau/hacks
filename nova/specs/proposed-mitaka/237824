Subject: [PATCH] Add Clustered LVM support to Libvirt LVM image backend

Nova libvirt driver supports LVM as its image backend and it can
also be used for Clustered LVM (CLVM). CLVM is an extended version
of Linux LVM2 on top of SAN storages to support concurrent access
from servers. To do so, it is based on clustering software like
Pacemaker/Corosync, DLM (Linux distributed lock manager) and
clvmd to share LVM metadata among servers safely. It's useful to
support VM live-migration between compute hosts sharing a CLVM pool.

The goal of this spec is to support live-migration on CLVM.

+==============================================
+Clustered LVM support as Libvirt image backend
+==============================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/libvirt-imagebackend-clvm
+
+This blueprint aims to add support for Clustered LVM to the LVM image
+backend driver of Libvirt plugin.
+
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+Nova libvirt driver supports LVM as its image backend and it can also
+be used for clustered LVM (CLVM). CLVM is an extended version of Linux
+LVM2 on top of SAN storages to support concurrent access from
+servers. To do so, it is based on clustering software like
+Pacemaker/Corosync, DLM (Linux distributed lock manager) and clvmd to
+share LVM metadata among servers safely. It's useful to support VM
+live-migration between compute hosts sharing a CLVM pool.
+
+However, Nova doesn't support VM live-migration on CLVM because the
+LVM image backend driver isn't marked as for shared storages.
+
+Use Cases
+----------
+
+A typical use case is like below:
+
+- A small private cloud; there are 20-50 compute nodes.
+- With VM HA; VM live migration and evacuation are required.
+- Heavy disk I/O; NFS image backend is not suitable.
+- Ceph isn't good as the image backend by a cost aspect.
+
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+Add is_shared_block_storage() to nova.virt.libvirt.imagebackend.Lvm class:
+
+.. code-block:: python
+
+    def is_shared_block_storage():
+        """True if the backend puts images on a shared block storage."""
+        return CONF.libvirt.clvm_enabled
+
+clvm_enabled is a boolean variable (defalut is False). True is set
+when CLVM is used as image backend.
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+Do nothing and CLVM is not supoprted.
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+None.
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+None.
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+
+Each host is able to access all images on the CLVM pool. But it's not
+a problem because using NFS image backend is the same.
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+
+None.
+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+
+None.
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+None.
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+A new configuration option "clvm_enabled" is added in [libvirt] group
+of nova.conf.
+
+Developer impact
+----------------
+
+None.
+
+
+Implementation

+
+Other contributors:
+  None
+
+Work Items
+----------
+
+* Add is_shared_block_storage() to nova.virt.libvirt.imagebackend.Lvm class:
+* Add a few unit tests for the above.
+
+
+Dependencies
+============
+
+None.
+
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+The new configuration parameter "clvm_enabled" is a boolean value, so
+2 test cases are required.
+
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+Add a description for the new configuration parameter "clvm_enabled".
