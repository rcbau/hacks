+Support triggering crash dump in an instance
+============================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/instance-crash-dump
+
+This spec adds a new API to trigger crash dump in an instance by injecting an
+NMI(Non-maskable Interruption) to the instance.
+
+Problem description
+===================
+For now, we can not trigger crash dump in an instance. But users need this
+functionality for some debug purpose.
+
+NMI(Non-maskable Interruption) can be used to trigger a special functionality.
+For example, in the mission critical area, it is necessary to trigger the
+kernel crash dump mechanism. This depends on the user configuration in the
+instance OS. User should configure the instance OS to trigger crash dump when
+it receives an NMI. In Linux, it can be done by::
+
+  $ echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/panic_on_io_nmi
+
+This means instance OS will wait 1s when it receives an NMI and then trigger
+crash dump.
+
+The kernel crash dump can be triggered by hand using the following command::
+
+  $ echo c > /proc/sysrq-trigger
+
+And if the kernel faces its bug(kernel panic), it triggers the kernel crash
+dump by itself. The reason/merit of NMI is we can trigger the kernel crash dump
+against a *stalling* instance.
+
+Although hypervisors support functionalities to inject an NMI to an instance,
+Nova doesn't have an API to do so.
+
+* Virsh supports the command "virsh inject-nmi" [1].
+
+* Ipmitool supports the command "ipmitool chassis power diag" [2].
+
+* Hyper-V Cmdlets supports the command
+  "Debug-VM -InjectNonMaskableInterrupt" [3].
+
+So we should add an API to inject NMI to instance in driver level, which has
+been done by https://review.openstack.org/#/c/202380/. And then add an Nova
+API to trigger crash dump in instance.
+
+Use Cases
+---------
+An end user needs an interface to trigger crash dump in his instances. By the
+trigger, the kernel crash dump mechanism dumps the production memory image as
+dump file, and reboot the kernel again. After that, the end user can get the
+dump file which is stored into his instance and investigate the problem reason
+based on the file.
+
+Project Priority
+----------------
+None
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+* Add a driver API to inject NMI to an instance.
+  (Already merged in Liberty: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/202380/)
+
+* Add a Nova API to trigger crash dump in instance using the API above.
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+None
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+None
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+* Specification for the method
+
+  * A description of what the method does suitable for use in
+    user documentation
+
+    * Injects an NMI to a server.
+
+  * Method type
+
+    * POST
+
+  * Normal http response code
+
+    * 202: Accepted
+
+  * Expected error http response code
+
+    * badRequest(400)
+
+      * When RPC doesn't support this API, this error will be returned. If a
+        driver does not implement the API, the error is handled by Instance
+        Action because the API is asynchronous.
+
+      * When a hypervisor fails to send an NMI, this code is used with an
+        error message including a reason.
+
+    * itemNotFound(404)
+
+      * There is no instance which has the specified uuid.
+
+    * conflictingRequest(409)
+
+      * The server status must be ACTIVE, PAUSED, RESCUED, RESIZED or ERROR.
+        If not, this code is returned.
+
+      * If the specified server is locked, this code is returned to a user
+        without administrator privileges. When using the kernel dump
+        mechanism, it causes a server reboot. So, only administrators can
+        send an NMI to a locked server as other power actions.
+
+  * URL for the resource
+
+    * /v2.1/servers/{server_id}/action
+
+  * Parameters which can be passed via the url
+
+    * A server uuid is passed.
+
+  * JSON schema definition for the body data
+
+    ::
+
+        {
+            "crash_dump": null
+        }
+
+  * JSON schema definition for the response data
+
+    * When the result is successful, no response body is returned.
+
+    * When an error occurs, the response data includes the error message [5].
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+None
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+None
+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+
+* A client API for this new API will be added to python-novaclient
+
+* A CLI for the new API will be added to python-novaclient. ::
+
+    nova crashdump <server>
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+None
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+The default policy for this API is for admin and owners by default.
+
+Developer impact
+----------------
+This change adds a new API to the driver.
+This spec will implement the new API  on the libvirt driver.

+
+Work Items
+----------
+* Add a new REST API.
+
+* Add a new driver API.
+
+* Implement the API on the libvirt driver.
+
+Dependencies
+============
+This spec is related to the blueprint in ironic.
+
+* https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ironic/+spec/enhance-power-interface-for-soft-reboot-and-nmi
+
+When the blueprint is approved, the ironic driver will implement the API with
+another blueprint.
+
+Testing
+=======
+Unit tests will be added.
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+The new API should be added to the documentation.
