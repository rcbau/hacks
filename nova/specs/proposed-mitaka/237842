Subject: [PATCH] Evacuate instance automatically

If nova-compute service is down by hardware failure,
an instance evacuate to another compute node automatically.
A super user is allowed to execute any script before or
after evacuation.

+==========================================
+Evacuate instance automatically
+==========================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/auto-evacuate-instance
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+Currently, A super user has to evacuate instance manually
+when nova-compute service is down.
+There is no feature which evacuate instance automatically
+in nova service.
+
+Use Cases
+----------
+
+If nova-compute service is down by hardware failure,
+an instance evacuate to another compute node automatically.
+A super user is allowed to execute any script before or
+after evacuation. It it useful for host fencing,
+controlling SDN or storages, notification, and so on.
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+Add a new service named nova-saver.
+nova-saver is the service which monitors all enabled compute hosts
+alive periodically and call 'evacuate instance' for instances
+on the inactive hosts.
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+It is possible to evacuate instance automatically by using a
+something monitoring system (e.g. Zabbix, Nagios).
+However, it requires some configuration to make it possible.
+A nova-saver is a one option to realize VM-HA feature
+for users who don't want to manage and develop extra service.
+A nova-saver is inside of nova, so user can make it possible
+easier than any other alternatives.
+And this service also has the meaning of promotion.
+OpenStack is often compared with other cloud service (e.g. VMware).
+At that time, It can be a demerit point
+to not having a VM-HA feature inside of Nova.
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+None
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+None
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+
+None
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+
+A notification of evacuation should be added.
+It should be notified the start and end of evacuation
+for each instance.
+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+
+None
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+There is no performance impact on existing service.
+A new service named nova-saver has a following performance impact.
+
+* A nova-saver has a periodic task which monitors all enabled
+  compute hosts via service API.
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+Following config options will be added in [saver] section
+of nova.conf.
+
+* retry_count - Maximum recheck time(s) before host evacuation.
+  Default is 3, so nova-saver kicks evacuation when it found
+  nova-compute is down 3 times sequencially.
+
+* evacuation_interval - Second(s) between each instance evacuation.
+
+* force_disabled - Mark host disabled before host evacuation.
+  If True, nova-saver marks inactive nova-compute 'disabled'
+  before instance evacuation. If False, after all instance
+  evacuation finished successfully.
+
+* on_shared_storage - Using a shared storage for ephemeral disk images.
+  If True, nova-saver kicks instance evacuation with
+  on_shared_storage=True.
+  If None, nova-compute detects whether ephemeral disks are
+  on a shared storage or not (since Liberty).
+
+* debug - Don't evacuate instances for test.
+
+* pre_script_host - Script path to execute before host evacuation.
+  nova-saver runs a command with an inactive hostname before
+  it starts evacuating instances on the host. Useful for
+  host fencing, controlling SDN or storages, notification,
+  and so on.
+
+* post_script_host - Script path to execute after host evacuation.
+  nova-saver runs a command with an inactive hostname after
+  it finishes evacuating instances on the host. Useful for
+  notification and so on.
+
+* pre_script_instance - Script path to execute before instance evacuation.
+  nova-saver runs a command with an UUID of instance before
+  it starts evacuating. Useful for instance fencing,
+  controlling SDN or storages, notification, and so on.
+
+* post_script_instance - Script path to execute after instance evacuation.
+  nova-saver runs a command with an UUID of instance after
+  it starts evacuating. Useful for notification and so on.

+
+Work Items
+----------
+
+Add following files newly:
+
+* nova/cmd/saver.py - A starter script for nova-saver.
+
+* nova/saver/manager.py - A main script of nova-saver.
+  It has a periodic task which monitors nova-compute and a evacuate method.
+
+* nova/saver/rpcapi.py - A client side of the nova-saver manager RPC API.
+
+* nova/tests/unit/saver/test_saver.py - Unit test of nova/saver/manager.py.
+
+
+Modify following files:
+
+* nova/service.py - Add a full class name of nova-saver in service_opts.
+
+* setup.cfg - Add a entry point of nova-saver.
+
+
+Dependencies
+============
+
+None
+
+
+Testing
+=======
+
+Both unit and Tempest tests need to be created to ensure
+that instance is evacuated automatically.
+
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+Need to be updated following documents.
+
+* Install Guide - Add a install guide of nova-saver.
+
+* Configuration Guide - Add a configuration guide of nova-saver.
