+===============================================
+Provide a way to pause VM during live migration
+===============================================
+
+Blueprint:
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/pause-vm-during-live-migration
+
+When using live migrations, an operator might want to have a possibility to
+increase success chance of migration even at the cost of longer VM downtime.
+This spec proposes a new nova API for pausing VM during live migration.
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+The most common use cases of live migration is host maintenance for different
+purposes. It might be, e.g., OpenStack upgrade to newer version or even
+hardware upgrade. Hypervisors have some features such as CPU throttling or
+memory compression to make it possible to live migrate every VM to other hosts.
+However, a VM might run workload that will prevent live migration from
+finishing. In such case operator might want to pause VM during live migration
+to stop memory writes on a VM.
+
+Another use case is imminent host failure where live migration duration might
+be crucial to keep VMs running regardless of VMs downtime during transition to
+destination host.
+
+Currently to pause VM during live migration operator needs to pause VM through
+libvirt/hypervisor. This pause is transparent for Nova as this is the same that
+happens during 'pause-and-copy' step during live migration.
+
+Use Cases
+----------
+
+As an operator of an OpenStack cloud, I would like the ability to pause VM
+during live migration to prevent VM from dirtying memory.
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+A new API method for pausing VM during live migration.
+The Migration object and MigrationList object will be used to establish which
+migrations exist, with additional optional data provided by the compute driver.
+
+This will need an increment to the rpcapi version too.
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+Alternative is not doing this and let operator pause VM manually through
+hypervisor.
+
+Another alternative is to reuse existing pause operation in nova. However, it
+might bring some confusion to operators. Libvirt preserves VM state that was
+in effect when live migration started. When live migration completes
+libvirt reverts VM state to preserved one. Example workflow:
+
+* VM is active
+* Operator start live migration
+* Libvirt preserves active state of a VM
+* Operator pauses VM (e.g., nova pause VM)
+* LM finishes
+* Libvirt reverts VM state to preserved one - in this case to active.
+
+Because of such behaviour it is not recommended to reuse existing pause
+operation. It might be confusing for operators that single operation has two
+different workflows.
+
+This also will be suitable for Tasks API.
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+None. The Migration objects used are already created and tracked by nova.
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+To be added in a new microversion.
+
+* Pause VM during live migration
+
+  `PUT /os-migrations/{instance_uuid}/{migration_uuid}`
+
+Body::
+
+  {
+    "pause-vm": bool
+  }
+
+  Normal http response code: `204 No Content`
+  No response body is needed
+
+  Expected error http: `400 Bad Request`
+  - the migration has finished or has been aborted
+
+  Expected error http response code: `404 Not Found`
+  - the migration does not exist
+
+  Expected error http response code: `405 Method not supported`
+  - it is not possible to pause VM during live migration, because hypervisor
+  does not support such operation.
+
+Policy: This does not need a separate policy control. It can be called by
+anyone who could have started the live migration, so can inherit that action's
+policy.
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+
+None
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+
+None

+Other end user impact

+  live migration
+
+Documentation Impact
+====================
+
+New API needs to be documented:
+
+* Compute API extensions documentation.

+
+* nova.compute.api documentation
